    <h2>Author: Suzanne Collins</h2>
    <p><strong>Genre:</strong> Fiction</p>
    <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Themes</strong></span></h2>
    <p><strong>Rebellion vs. Conformity</strong>-the main character
        fights against "fitting in", fights against the old ways</p>
    <p><strong>The Frontier</strong>-A survival story, an adventure in
        an unexplored area</p>
    <p><strong>Individualism</strong>-Individual rights, Human rights,
        free will, individual desires</p>
    <p><strong>Suffering/Sports as Entertainment-</strong>in reality TV
        and sports the people/players become objects and lose their
        humanity</p>
    <p><strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"The rules of The
                Hunger Games are simple. In punishment for the uprising, each of
                the twelve districts must provide one girl and one boy, called
                tributes, to participate. The twenty four tributes will be
                imprisoned in a vast outdoor arena...Over a period of several
                weeks, the competitors must fight to the death. The last tribute
                standing wins...this is the Capitol's way of reminding us of how
                totally we are at their mercy. How little chance we would stand of
                surviving another rebellion...To make it humiliating as well as
                torturous, the Capitol requires us to treat the Hunger Games as a
                festivity, a sporting event pitting every district against the
                others" (18-19).</span></strong></p>

            male tribute.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: black;">Katniss is disturbed that Peeta is
            chosen and recalls the time 5 years ago, when Peeta saved her
            family from starvation. Peeta and his mother saw Katniss searching
            for food in the trash bin behind their bakery. Peeta's mother
            chases Katniss away from the garbage cans. <span style="color: crimson;"><strong>Peeta purposely and
                    defiantly</strong></span> burned 2 loaves of bread, suffered a blow
            to the face from his mother for his mistake and threw the loaves of
            bread to Katniss.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: black;">The next day at school, Katniss is
            embarrassed when she sees Peeta and looks down at the ground and
            sees the first dandelion of the spring (food). The bread gave
            Katniss hope and the dandelion inspires Katniss to forage for food
            in the woods. <span style="color: dodgerblue;"><strong>"To this
                    day, I can never shake the connection between this boy, Peeta
                    Mellark, and the bread that gave me hope, and the dandelion that
                    reminded me that I was not doomed" (32).</strong></span></span>
        <span style="color: black;">Katniss is now worried that she might
            have to kill the boy who saved her family years ago, Peeta,&nbsp;
            during The Hunger Games. <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"Oh well, I think. There will be

    <p><strong>Leaving District 12<br></strong></p>
    <p>Katniss and Peeta travel by car and then by train with Effie
        Trinket to the Capital. District 12 is in the Appalachian Mountains
        and the Capitol of Panem is in a place once called the Rocky
        Mountains (Denver).</p>
    <p>Katniss has never been in a car or on a train. She is fed
        amazing food and watches the reapings from all the districts on
        TV.</p>
    <p>As Katniss travels to the Capitol, she realizes Madge has given
        her a mockingjay pin. The mockingjay is a symbol of rebellion.

    <p><span style="color: crimson;">&nbsp;The purpose of Chapter 4 is

                dangerous to me than an unkind one Kind people have a way of

    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;"><span style="color: black;">Katniss remembers the past and reveals that her
                mother is an apothecary who has a book about plants. Katniss used
                her mother's book and notes from her father to find edible foods
                for their survival.</span></span></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;"><span style="color: black;">The
                reader learns that Katniss is also named after a plant like her
                sister Primrose. <span style="color: dodgerblue;">"In the late
                    summer, I was washing up in a pond when I noticed the plants
                    growing around me. <strong>Tall with leaves like
                        arrowheads</strong>. Blossoms with three white petals. I knelt down
                    in the water, my fingers digging into the soft mud, and I pulled up
                    handfuls of the roots. Small, bluish tubers that <strong>don't look
                        like much</strong>&nbsp; but boiled or baked are as good as any
                    potato. 'Katniss,' I said aloud. It's the plant I was named for.
                    And I heard my father's voice joking, <strong>'As long as you can
                        find yourself, you'll never starve'</strong> "
                    (52).</span></span></span></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;"><span style="color: black;">Primrose is named after a pale yellow delicate,
                beautiful flower that blooms in the spring. In contrast, Katniss is
                named after a sensible, practical root plant, that doesn't look
                like much. Interestingly, the plant has arrow like leaves and you
                have to get dirty to dig it out of the mud. The katniss plant may
                not be pretty, but you can survive by eating it.</span></span></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;"><span style="color: black;">The
                next morning of the train, Peeta fights with Haymitch because he is
                already drunk and Katniss uses her knife to stab the table
                preventing Haymitch from having another drink. Haymitch realizes
                that Peeta and Katniss are fighters.Haymtich is impressed with
                Katniss and Peeta, he agrees to mentor and give them advice if they
                don't interfere with his drinking. <span style="color: dodgerblue;"><strong>"All right, I'll make a deal
                        with you.
                        You don't interfere with my drinking, and I'll stay sober enough to
                        help you...But you have to do exactly what I say"
                        (58).</strong></span><br></span></span></p>
    <p><span style="color: black;">Haymitch's first piece of advice for
            Katniss and Peeta is to do everything the stylist for the Hunger
            Games tell them to do so that Katniss and Peeta will be
            at</span><span style="color: black;">tractive and increase their
            popularity with the audience.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: black;">As the train pulls into the
            Capitol,&nbsp; Peeta rushes to the window to wave to the crowd.
            Katniss realizes Peeta is trying to win over the crowd and has a
            plan to survive the Games. Katniss is suspicious and does NOT trust
            Peeta. <span style="color: dodgerblue;"><strong>"He hasn't accepted
                    his death. He is already fighting hard to stay alive. Which also
                    means that kind Peeta Mellark, the boy who gave me the bread, is
                    fighting hard to kill me" (60).</strong></span></span></p>

        denial. Effie Trinket points out that Katniss could not possibly

    <p>The Roof</p>
    <p>After dinner Katniss and Peeta go to the roof of the Training
        Center to talk. The roof is surrounded by an electrical field that
        prevents anyone from falling off the roof or jumping off to commit
        suicide, to get out of the Games.</p>
    <p>So they will not be overheard by any listening devices, Katniss
        and Peeta talk quietly and use the noise from hundreds of wind
        chimes to drown out their voices. Katniss explains to Peeta how she
        and Gale did see the Avox girl and a boy one day while they were
        hunting in the woods. The girl and boy had escaped from the Capitol
        District and were running away. Suddenly a hovercraft appeared in
        the sky. The girl was captured in a net and hauled into the
        hovercraft. The boy was speared (dead) and hauled into the
        hovercraft. Katniss feels guilty over this event because she is
        convinced the Avox girl saw her and asked for help. Katniss was to
        afraid and selfish to help.</p>
    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: crimson;">Relationships</span></p>
    <p>Peeta learns from Katniss that she is not related to Gale, and
        considers Gale her friend.</p>
    <p>Katniss learns from Peeta that his father, the baker, Mr.
        Mellark, knew her mother from his childhood. Katniss' mother did
        grew up in town and her family were merchants like the

    <p>As Katniss is falling asleep, the red haired Avox returns to her
        room. Katniss realizes she stood by and watched the girl's capture
        and did nothing. The girl was then mutilated (tongue cut
        out).Katniss is just like everyone who watches The Hunger

    <p>Katniss has special talents: she is good with a knife, has some

        can hunt for food and is strong and fast.</p>
    <p>Peeta is strong from lifting 100 pound bags of flour and can
        wrestle.</p>
    <p>Haymitch decides they will train together, must always be seen
        together, getting along and should not reveal any special skills or
        talents to the other tributes.</p>
    <p>Katniss and Peeta will only reveal their skills/talents to the
        Gamemakers in their private sessions.</p>

    <p>The Gamemakers are bored and drunk on wine and don't pay

        Gamemakers are paying more attention to the dead pig on their

                early. You see an elderly person, and you want to congratulate them
                on their longevity, ask the secret of survival. A plump person is
                envied because they aren't scraping by like the majority of us. But
                here it is different. Wrinkles are desirable. A round belly isn't a

    <p>During Peeta's Interview with Caesar Flickerman, the crowd goes

    <p>After the Interviews, Katniss is furious at Peeta because he

                It is part of the strategy to win The Games. Haymitch tells
                Katniss, " You're golden, sweetheart. You're going to have sponsors

    <p>Katniss is shocked that Peeta is fighting with the tributes.</p>
    <p>She sees that Peeta is bruised and realizes he must have fought
        with the others at the Cornucopia.</p>
    <p>Katniss overhears "The Careers" discussing her score of 11 in

        fire on purpose for the entertainment of the audience.
        <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"This was no tribute's
                campfire gone out of control, no accidental occurrence. The flames

                marks them as human-made, machine-made. Things have been too quiet
                today. No deaths, perhaps no fights at all. The audience in the
                Capitol will be getting bored, claiming that these Games are
                verging on dullness. This is the one thing the Games must not

    <p>Katniss is hit by a fireball on her calf (leg).</p>
    <p>Katniss burns her hands as she puts out the fire on her pant
        leg.</p>
    <p><strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"The fireball crashes
                into the ground at my side, but not before it skids across my right

                carrying images of rich fabric and sparkling gems, 'Katniss, the
                girl who was on fire.' What a good laugh the Gamemakers must be
                having over that one. Perhaps, Cinn's beautiful costumes have even
                brought on this particular torture for me"

                and what the tracker jacker Venom had caused me to imagine. But if
                he did, and my in stincts tell me he did, what for? Is he simply
                working the Lov-er Boy angle he initiated at the interview? Or was
                he actually trying to protect me? And if he was, what was he doing

    <p>Katniss gets up, finds a stream (water), cleans herself up and
        goes hunting for food.</p>
    <p>Now that she has a bow and arrow, Katniss feels she has a chance
        to survive in the Games.</p>
    <p>Katniss hears a twig snap. It is Rue</p>
    <p>Rue and Katniss join forces and become allies to fight
        together.</p>
    <p><strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">“Then I spot the tip of
                a child’s boot just peeking out from behind the trunk of a tree. My
                shoulders relax and I grin. She can move through the woods like a
                shadow, you have to give her that. How else could she have followed
                me? The words come out of my mouth before I can stop them.“You
                know, they’re not the only ones who can form alliances, “I say. For
                a moment, no response. Then one of Rue’s eyes edges around the
                trunk. “You want me for an ally?” “Why not? You saved me with those
                trackerjackers. You’re smart enough to still be alive. And I can’t
                seem to shake you anyway, “I say” (200).</span></strong></p>
    <p>Katniss shares her food with Rue and Rue uses her knowledge of
        plants/leaves to heal Katniss' tracker jacker wounds.</p>
    <p>Katniss realizes that Haymitch will probably be furious with her
        for her alliance with Rue, but Katniss likes Rue and she reminds
        Katniss of her sister, Prim.</p>
    <p><strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">“I can almost hear
                Haymitch groaning as I team up with this wispy child. But I want
                her. Because she’s a survivor, and I trust her, and why not admit
                it? She reminds me of Prim…Okay, “she says, and holds out her hand.
                We shake. “It’s a deal.”Of course, this kind of deal can only be
                temporary, but neither of us mentions that”
                (201).</span></strong></p>
    <p>Rue is from District 11, the agricultural district. Rue tells
        Katniss, that even though they grow food in District 11, the people
        are starving and they are whipped if they steal food.</p>
    <p><strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">“‘I’d have thought, in
                District Eleven, you’d have a bit more to eat than us. You know,
                since you grow the food, “I say. Rue’s eyes widen. “Oh, no, we’re
                not allowed to eat the crops.”“They arrest you or something?”I ask.
                “They whip you and make everyone else watch, “says Rue. “The
                mayor’s very strict about it” (202).</span></strong></p>
    <p>Rue is very skilled at climbing, moving and hiding in the
        trees.</p>
    <p>She has been hidiing in the trees and spying on the other
        tributes.</p>
    <p>Katniss and Rue share their equipment, Rue has a pair of night
        vision goggles and they share Katniss' sleeping bag.</p>
    <p>Rue tells Katniss that Peeta is no longer with the Careers.</p>
    <p>The Careers have set up a camp at the Cornucopia and have all
        the food and weapons they need.</p>
    <p>Katniss begins planning a way to destroy the Career Tributes
        camp and supplies at the Cornucopia.</p>
    <p>There are 10 tributes left in the Hunger Games, 14 have

                    Just eight of us. The betting must be getting really hot in the
                    Capitol. They’ll be doing special features on each of us now.
                    Probably interviewing our friends and families. It’s been a long
                    time since a tribute from District 12 made it into the top eight.

    <p><strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"it’s Foxface, standing
                in the rubble of the pyramid and laughing. She’s smarter than the
                Careers, actually finding a few useful items in the ashes. A metal
                pot. A knife blade. I’m perplexed by her amusement until I realize
                that with the Careers’ stores eliminated, she might actually stand
                a chance. Just like the rest of us. It crosses my mind to reveal
                myself and enlist her as a second ally against that pack. But I
                rule it out. There’s something about that sly grin that makes me
                sure that befriending Foxface would ultimately get me a knife in
                the back. With that in mind, this might be an excellent time to
                shoot her. But she’s heard something, not me, because her head
                turns away, toward the drop-off, and she sprints for the woods. I
                wait. No one, nothing shows up. Still, if Foxface thought it was
                dangerous, maybe it’s time for me to get out of here,
                too(227).<br></span></strong></p>

            Rue’s song, and she follows the trail of song.</span></p>
    <p><strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"I’ve stopped for just
                a moment when I hear it. I have to cock my head around to the side
                to be sure, but there it is again. Rue’s four-note tune coming out
                of a mockingjay’s mouth. The one that means she’s all right. I grin
                and move in the direction of the bird. Another just a short
                distance ahead, picks up on the handful of notes. Rue has been
                singing to them, and recently. Otherwise they’d have taken up some
                other song. My eyes lift up into the trees, searching for a sign of
                her. I swallow and sing softly back, hoping she’ll know it’s safe
                to join me. A mockingjay repeats the melody to me"

            toward the Capitol build in her.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: black;">Thinking of what Peeta once told

    <p><span style="color: black;"><strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"Then I remember Peeta’s words on the roof.

            around aimlessly.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: black;">As she’s about to make camp that
            night, a gift arrives. It’s a loaf of bread, the kind Peeta taught
            her is from District 11.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: black;">She thinks of the people from
            District 11 without enough to eat, pooling their money to give her
            this, and she thanks them aloud<strong>.</strong></span></p>

                    of
                    bread It’s not the fine white Capitol stuff. It’s made of dark
                    ration grain and shaped in a crescent. Sprinkledwith seeds. I flash
                    back to Peeta’s lesson on the various district breads in the
                    Training Center. This bread came from District 11. I cautiously
                    lift the still warmloaf. What must it have cost the people of
                    District 11 who can’t even feed themselves? How many would’ve had
                    to do without to scrape up a coin to put in the collection for this
                    one loaf? It had been meant for Rue, surely. But instead of pulling
                    the gift when she died, they’d authorized Haymitch to give it to
                    me. As a thank-you? Or because, like me, they don’t like to let
                    debts go unpaid? For</span><br>

    <p>As the day goes on she replays the events of Rue’s death in her

                guess technically I’d get credited for Glimmer and the girl from
                District 4, too, for dumping that nest on them. But the boy from
                District 1 was the first person I knew would die because of my
                actions. Numerous animals have lost their lives at my hands, but

                Entirely different in the aftermath. I killed a boy whose name I
                don’t even know. Somewhere his family is weeping for him. His
                friends call for my blood. Maybe he had a girlfriend who really
                believed he would come back . . .But then I think of Rue’s still

                the rules? For two tributes to have a shot at winning, our
                “romance” must be so popular with the audience that condemning it
                would jeopardize the success of the Games. No thanks to me. All
                I’ve done is managed not to kill Peeta. But whatever he’s done in

                Fighting Cato to let me escape. Even hooking up with the Careers

    <p><span style="color: black;">He is lying on the ground,
            camouflaged in mud. Peeta’s skill frosting cakes has paid
            off.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: black;"><strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"My foot has just broken the surface of the
                    water when I hear a voice.</span></strong> <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">“You here to

                    the left, so I
                    can’t pick it up very well. And the voice was hoarse and weak.
                    Still, it must have been Peeta. Who else in the arena would call me
                    sweetheart? My eyes peruse the bank, but there’s nothing. Just mud,
                    the plants, the base of the rocks.</span></strong>
            <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">“Peeta?” I whisper. “Where
                    are you?” There’s no answer. Could I just have imagined it? No, I’m
                    certain it was real and very close at hand, too. “Peeta?” I creep
                    along the bank.</span></strong> <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">“Well, don’t step on me.” I
                    jump back. His
                    voice was right under my feet. Still there’s nothing. Then his eyes
                    open, unmistakably blue in the brown mud and green leaves. I gasp
                    and am</span></strong> <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">rewarded with a hint of white teeth
                    as he
                    laughs. It’s the final word in camouflage. Forget chucking weights
                    around. Peeta should have gone into his private session with the
                    Gamemakers and painted himself into a tree. Or a boulder. Or a
                    muddy bank full of weeds...His face and arms are so artfully
                    disguised as to be invisible. I kneel</span></strong>
            <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">beside him. “I guess all
                    those hours decorating cakes paid off.” Peeta smiles. “Yes,
                    frosting. The final defense of the dying.”"
                    (252).</span></strong><br></span></p>
    <p><span style="color: black;">His leg is badly cut, and he can
            barely move.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: black;">With great difficulty and care,
            Katniss cleans him up, stripping off most of his mud-caked
            clothing, and treats the infected wound as best she can.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: black;">They need to move, but Peeta can’t
            walk, so Katniss helps him to a cave where he’ll be
            hidden.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: black;">Peeta starts telling her what to do
            if he doesn’t survive, but Katniss tells him not to talk like
            that.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: black;"><strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">“Lean down a minute first,” he says. “Need
                    to
                    tell you something.” I lean over and put my good ear to his lips,
                    which tickle as he whispers. “Remember, we’re madly in love, so
                    it’s all right to kiss me anytime you feel like it"
                    (253).</span></strong><br></span></p>
    <p><span style="color: black;">She kisses him, thinking of how
            they’re supposed to be in love.</span></p>

    <p><span style="color: black;">She steps outside, and a new gift
            from Haymitch arrives. It’s a pot of hot broth, and Katniss
            realizes Haymitch wants her to play up the romance.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: black;"><strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"Haymitch couldn’t be sending me a clearer
                    message. One kiss equals one pot of broth. I can almost hear his

            <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">The boy’s dying. Give me

    <p><span style="color: black;">Nursing the goat back to health
            "paid off" for Katniss' family, the goat has provided the family

                “A story? What about?” I say. I’m not much for storytelling. It’s

                anything, the Meadow’s a perfect feeding place, and they can give
                four quarts of milk a day. To drink, to make into cheese, to sell.

                    in the reaping,” says Peeta drily. “The goat has paid for itself.

                    indifference when he says, “Now hold on. Some of you may already be
                    declining my invitation. But this is no ordinary feast. Each of you
                    needs something desperately.” I do need something desperately.
                    Something to heal Peeta’s leg. “Each of you will find that
                    something in a backpack, marked with your district number, at the
                    Cornucopia at dawn. Think hard about refusing to show up. For some
                    of you, this will be your last chance,” says Claudius. There’s
                    nothing else, just his words hanging in the air. I jump as Peeta
                    grips my shoulder from behind. “No,” he says. “You’re not risking
                    your life for me" (274).</strong></span><br></span></p>

                    would he be, if I opened that door? He talked about us running away

    <p><span style="color: black;">Peeta reminds Katniss that here in

    <p><strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">“Peeta,” I say lightly.

                had on a red plaid dress and your hair . . . it was in two braids
                instead of one. My father pointed you out when we were waiting to
                line up,” Peeta says.<br>
                “Your father? Why?” I ask.<br>
                “He said, ‘See that little girl? I wanted to marry her mother, but
                she ran off with a coal miner,’” Peeta says.<br>
                “What? You’re making that up!” I exclaim.</span></strong></p>
    <p><strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">“No, true story,” Peeta

                she could’ve had you?’</span></strong></p>
    <p><strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">And he said, ‘Because

                “That’s true. They do. I mean, they did,” I say. I’m stunned and
                surprisingly moved, thinking of the baker telling this to Peeta. It
                strikes me that my own reluctance to sing, my own dismissal of
                music might not really be that I think it’s a waste of time. It
                might be because it reminds me too much of my father.<br>
                “So that day, in music assembly, the teacher asked who knew the
                valley song. Your hand shot right up in the air. She stood you up
                on a stool and had you sing it for us. And I swear, every bird
                outside the windows fell silent,” Peeta says"

                    Victor"<br></span></strong></span></h2>
    <p><span style="color: black;">Katniss and Peeta carefully eat the
            food Haymitch sent. They have been starving and don't want to eat
            too much and get sick.</span></p>
    <p><strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"Every cell in my body
                wants me to dig into the stew and cram it, handful by handful into
                my mouth...“We better take it slow on that stew. Remember the first
                night on the train? The rich food made me sick and I wasn’t even
                starving then...We are quite sensible. We each have a roll, half an
                apple, and an egg-size serving of stew and rice.“I want more.” “Me,
                too. Tell you what. We wait an hour, if it stays down, then we get
                another serving,” Peeta says" (303).<br></span></strong></p>
    <p><span style="color: black;">They discuss how winning the Games
            would impact their lives.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: black;">Katniss would no longer be a girl
            from the Seam, she and her family would live in the Victor's
            Village. Their only neighbor would be Haymitch.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: black;">Only 2 tributes from District 12
            have ever won the Hunger Games. The other tribute is dead and
            Haymitch, an alcoholic, lives in the Victor's Village all
            alone.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: black;"><strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"if we make it back, you won’t be agirl from
                    the Seam, you’ll be a girl from the Victor’s Village,” he says.
                    That’s right. If we win, we’ll each get a house in the part of town
                    reserved for</span></strong> <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">Hunger Games’ victors. Long
                    ago, when the
                    Games began, the Capitol had built a dozen fine houses in each
                    district. Of course, in ours only one is occupied. Most of the
                    others have never been lived in at all. A disturbing thought hits
                    me. “But then, our only neighbor will be Haymitch!”
                    (304).</span></strong><br></span></p>
    <p><span style="color: black;">Katniss and Peeta try to figure out
            how Haymitch won the Hunger Games when he was a tribute.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: black;"><strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">“Haymitch. How do you think he won the
                    Games?”
                    I say. Peeta considers this quite a while before he answers.
                    Haymitch is sturdily built, but no physical wonder like Cato or
                    Thresh. He’s not particularly handsome. Not in the way that causes
                    sponsors to rain gifts on you. And he’s so surly, it’s hard to
                    imagine anyone teaming up with him. There’s only one way Haymitch
                    could have won, and Peeta says it just as I’m reaching this
                    conclusion myself. “He outsmarted the
                    others,”</span></strong></span> <span style="color: dodgerblue;"><strong>says Peeta
                (30</strong><strong>6</strong>).<br></span></p>
    <p><span style="color: black;">Katniss begins to consider that
            Haymitch, although he has won the Games, and lives in the Victor's
            Village, has a difficult life and it must be hellish to be a mentor
            for a tribute.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: black;"><strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">“He’s never sober!” I protest...He’s at
                    something of a <span style="color: black;">disadvantage</span>
                    because most mentors have a partner, another victor to help them
                    whereas Haymitch has to be ready to go into action at any moment.
                    Kind of like me when I was alone in the arena. I wonder how he’s
                    holding up, with the drinking, the attention, and <span style="color: black;">the stress</span> of
                    trying to keep us
                    alive...secretly I’m wondering if Haymitch sobered up long enough
                    to help Peeta and me because he thought we just might have the wits
                    to survive. <span style="color: black;">Maybe he wasn’t always a
                        drunk.</span> Maybe, in the beginning, he tried to help the
                    tributes. But then it got unbearable. <span style="color: black;">It must be hell to mentor two kids
                        and then watch
                        them die.</span> Year after year after year. I realize that if I
                    get out of here, that will become my job. To mentor the girl from
                    District 12. The idea is so repellent, I thrust it from my mind"
                    (304-306).</span></strong></span></p>

            displayed in the night sky.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: black;"><img id="yui_3_5_1_2_1453829142922_728" style="width: 400px; height: 267px;"

                alt="" width="400" height="267"></span></p>
    <p><span style="color: black;">Katniss is upset that Thresh has
            died, she had hoped if she and Peeta did not win the Games, that
            Thresh could be the winner.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: black;">Katniss thinks, Thresh is not just
            dead, he has been <strong>murdered.</strong></span></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;"><strong>&nbsp;“Thresh is dead,”
                says Peeta...</strong></span></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;"><strong>For about ten seconds,
                I catch a distorted glimpse of Thresh’s</strong></span>
        <span style="color: dodgerblue;"><strong>picture and then he’s
                gone. Just like that...Thresh dead. I should be happy, right? One
                less tribute to face. And a powerful</strong></span> <span style="color: dodgerblue;"><strong>one, too.
                But I’m not happy. All I can
                think about is Thresh letting me go, letting</strong></span>
        <span style="color: dodgerblue;"><strong>me run because of Rue, who
                died with that spear in her stomach. . . .Rue was one
                thing.</strong></span><br>
        <span style="color: dodgerblue;"><strong>We were allies. She was so
                young. But no one will understand my sorrow at</strong></span>
        <span style="color: dodgerblue;"><strong>Thresh’s murder. The word
                pulls me up short. Murder! Thankfully, I didn’t say
                it</strong></span> <span style="color: dodgerblue;"><strong>aloud.
                That’s not going to win me any points in the arena. What I do say
                is, “It’s</strong></span> <span style="color: dodgerblue;"><strong>just . . . if we didn’t win . . . I
                wanted Thresh to. Because he let me go. And</strong></span>
        <span style="color: dodgerblue;"><strong>because of
                Rue.”</strong></span> <span style="color: dodgerblue;"><strong>“Yeah, I know,” says Peeta. “But this
                means we’re one step closer to District</strong></span>
        <span style="color: dodgerblue;"><strong>Twelve"
                (307-308).</strong></span>
    </p>
    <p><strong><span style="color: black;">4 Tributes remain in the
                Games: Cato (1), Fox Face (5) and Katniss and Peeta from District
                12.</span></strong></p>
    <p><span style="color: black;">Katniss and Peeta know that Cato, a
            Career from District 1, is their biggest threat now that Thresh is
            dead.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: black;">Katniss dislikes Fox Face who has
            survived thus far by being smarter and faster than the other
            Tributes.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: black;">Katniss and Peeta are sleeping and
            guarding the cave in shifts.</span></p>
    <p><strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">“It also means Cato
                will be back hunting us.”<br>
                “And he’s got supplies again,” says Peeta.<br>
                “He’ll be wounded, I bet,” I say.<br>
                “What makes you say that?” Peeta asks.<br>
                “Because Thresh would have never gone down without a fight. He’s so
                strong, I mean, he was. And they were in his territory,” I say.<br>
                “Good,” says Peeta. “The more wounded Cato is the better. I wonder
                how Foxface is making out.”<br>
                “Oh, she’s fine,” I say peevishly. I’m still angry she thought of
                hiding in the Cornucopia and I didn’t. “Probably be easier to catch
                Cato than her.”<br>
                “Maybe they’ll catch each other and we can just go home,” says
                Peeta. “But we better be extra careful about the watches. I dozed
                off a few times.”</span></strong></p>
    <p><span style="color: black;"><strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">“Me, too,” I admit. “But not tonight.”
                    (308-309).</span></strong><br></span></p>
    <p><span style="color: black;">Peeta makes a tart from bread,
            cheese and apples like the tarts his family makes in their bakery
            back home.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: black;">Peeta explains to Katniss, his
            family (who own the bakery) cannot afford to eat the tarts they
            make, they eat only the stale leftovers.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: black;">Katniss is surprised, she always
            assumed that the shopkeepers in District 12 were
            well-off.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: black;">Katniss realizes that while Peeta's
            family always has food to eat, their food is old and stale, while
            her family has to hunt and forage for food it is always fresh
            food.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: black;"><strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">“We make a goat cheese and apple tart at the
                    bakery,” he says.</span></strong><br>
            <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">“Bet that’s expensive,” I
                    say.</span></strong><br>
            <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">“Too expensive for my
                    family to eat. Unless it’s gone very stale. Of
                    course,</span></strong> <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">practically everything we eat is
                    stale,” says
                    Peeta, pulling the sleeping bag up</span></strong>
            <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">around him. In less than a
                    minute, he’s snoring.</span></strong><br>
            <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">Huh. I always assumed the
                    shopkeepers live a soft life. And it’s true, Peeta has always had
                    enough to eat. But there’s something kind</span></strong>
            <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">of depressing about living
                    your life on stale bread, the hard, dry loaves that no
                    one</span></strong> <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">else
                    wanted. One thing about us, since I bring our food home on a daily
                    basis,</span></strong> <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">most of it is so fresh you have to
                    make sure
                    it isn’t going to make a run for it"
                    (309-310).</span></strong><br></span></p>
    <p><span style="color: black;">As Katniss lies awake on guard duty,
            she begins to think what life will be like in District 12 if she
            wins the Games. WILL SHE CHANGE? WILL SHE LOSE HER IDENTITY?
            FORESHADOWING!</span></p>
    <p><strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"Four of us left.<br>
                For the first time, I allow myself to truly think about the
                possibility that I might make it home. To fame. To wealth. To my
                own house in the Victor’s Village. My mother and Prim would live
                there with me. No more fear of hunger. A new kind of freedom. But
                then . . . what? What would my life be like on a daily basis? Most
                of it has been consumed with the acquisition of food. Take that
                away and I’m not really sure who I am, what my identity is. The
                idea scares me some. I think of Haymitch, with all his money. What
                did his life become? He lives alone, no wife or children, most of
                his waking hours drunk. I don’t want to end up like that"
                (310-311).<br></span></strong></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;"><span style="color: black;">The
                next day, Katniss and Peeta must leave the cave to hunt and forage
                for food.</span><br></span></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;"><span style="color: black;">While they are hunting, Peeta points out that they
                are being hunted by Cato.</span></span></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;"><span style="color: black;"><strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">“He’ll be
                        hunting us by now,” says Peeta. “Cato isn’t one to wait for his
                        prey to wander by.”</span></strong><br>
                <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">“If he’s wounded —” I
                        begin.</span></strong><br>
                <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">“It won’t matter,” Peeta
                        breaks in. “If he can move, he’s coming"
                        (313).</span></strong><br></span></span></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;"><span style="color: black;">Peeta is a disasterous hunter. He crashes through
                the woods and is too LOUD.</span></span></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;"><span style="color: black;">Katniss shows Peeta edible plants in the
                woods.</span></span></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;"><span style="color: black;">Katniss and Peeta split up, Katniss will hunt,
                while Peeta gathers edible roots, berries and
                leaves.</span></span></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;"><span style="color: black;">They keep in contact by whistling to each
                other.</span></span></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;"><span style="color: black;">As
                Peeta gathers food he leaves the berries and roots on a plastic
                sheet.</span></span></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;"><span style="color: black;">Katniss becomes alarmed when she see the food but
                has not heard from Peeta in a while.</span></span></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;"><span style="color: black;">When she finds Peeta she is angry, he has not kept
                in touch with her and as she looks at the food, she accuses him of
                eathing without her.</span></span></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;"><span style="color: black;">Just then the cannon fires. Another tribute has
                died.</span></span></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;"><span style="color: black;">Katniss and Peeta watch as a hovercraft lifts
                Foxface's dead body into the sky.</span></span></p>

                        to the ground, but he only raises his eyebrows. The hovercraft
                        appears a hundred yards or so away. What’s left of Foxface’s
                        emaciated body is lifted into the air. I can see the red glint of

    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;"><span style="color: black;">Katniss realizes that Foxface had stolen some of
                their food, so she looks closely at the berries and remembers
                advice from her father.</span></span></p>
    <p><strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"My father’s voice
                comes back to me. “Not these, Katniss. Never these. They’re

                (318).</span></strong></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;"><span style="color: black;">Peeta thinks that Foxface was killed by Cato and

    <p><span style="color: black;">Katniss explains to Peeta that
            Foxface must have eaten the nightlock berries, which are
            poisonous.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: black;">She tells Peeta that Foxface has
            survivied thus far by stealing food from the Careers at the
            Cornucopia. Foxface had been very shrewd.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: black;">Peeta outsmarted Foxface.</span></p>

            <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"It takes a while to

                    stay alive but not enough that anyone would notice it, how she

                    ourselves.she’s very clever, Peeta. Well, she was. Until you
                    outfoxed her" (320).<br></span></strong></span></p>
    <p><span style="color: black;">Katniss and Peeta save the remaining

                kill Cato. And really, wasn’t he always the one to kill?
                (327).<br></strong></span></p>
    <p><span style="color: black;">The next morning as they go to the

            back to the Cornucopia and the Lake for water or they will die of

    <p><strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"we reach the stream.
                Or what used to be the stream. Now there’s only a bone-dry bed. I
                put my hand down to feel it.<br>
                “Not even a little damp. They must have drained it while we slept,”
                I say. A fear of the cracked tongue, aching body and fuzzy mind
                brought on by my previous dehydration creeps into my consciousness.
                Our bottles and skin are fairly full, but with two drinking and
                this hot sun it won’t take long to deplete them.<br>
                “The lake,” says Peeta. “That’s where they want us to go.”<br>
                “Maybe the ponds still have some,” I say hopefully.“We can check,”
                he says, but he’s just humoring me. I’m humoring myself because I
                know what I’ll find when we return to the pond where I soaked my
                leg. A dusty, gaping mouth of a hole. But we make the trip anyway
                just to confirm what we already know.<br>
                “You’re right. They’re driving us to the lake,” I say. Where
                there’s no cover. Where they’re guaranteed a bloody fight to the
                death with nothing to block their view"
                (326-327).<br></span></strong></p>
    <p><span style="color: black;">Katniss and Peeta arrive at the
            Cornucopia. There is no sign of Cato and sit in the open
            waiting.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: black;">Suddenly, Cato appears, he is
            charging towards them</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: black;">Katniss hits Cato with an arrow,
            which bounces right off him. He is wearing some sort of body
            armor.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: black;">Cato runs right past Katniss and
            Peeta. He is running for his life. Strange creatures are pursuing
            Cato.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: black;">Katniss and Peeta turn and
            run.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;"><strong>"Cato is upon us. I
                brace myself, but he rockets right between us with no attempt to

                his purplish face, that he’s been running hard a long time. Not
                toward us. From something. But what? My eyes scan the woods just in
                time to see the first creature leap onto the plain. As I’m turning
                away, I see another half dozen join it. Then I am stumbling blindly

    <p><span style="color: black;">They are muttations, that look like

    <p><strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"Muttations. No
                question about it. I’ve never seen these mutts, but they’re no
                natural-born animals... I realize what else unsettled me about the
                mutts. The green eyes glowering at me are unlike any dog or wolf,
                any canine I’ve ever seen. They are unmistakably human. And that
                revelation has barely registered when I notice the collar with the
                number 1 inlaid with jewels and the whole horrible thing hits me.
                The blonde hair, the green eyes, the number . . . it’s Glimmer...
                My head snaps from side to side as I examine the pack, taking in
                the various sizes and colors. The small one with the red coat and
                amber eyes . . . Foxface! And there, the ashen hair and hazel eyes

    <p>Cato is dragged into the Cornucopia and slowly tortured by the

    <p>The Gamemakers are making a spectacle out of Cato's slow and
        painful death.</p>
    <p>Peeta is bleeding heavily from his leg wound, so Katniss makes a
        tourniquet for his leg with her final arrow.</p>
    <p>Despite the tourniquet, Peeta will bleed to death soon.</p>
    <p>Katniss finally climbs to the edge of the Cornucopia to end

    <p>She removes the arrow from Peeta's tourniquet, putting his life

                and pulls me closer to him.</span></strong><br>
        <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">And I do. No viewer could

                sound, and I know where his mouth is. And I think the word he’s
                trying to say is please. Pity, not vengeance, sends my arrow flying
                into his skull" (339-341).</span></strong>
    </p>
    <p>The rule change clearly stated that if 2 tributes from the same

    <p>Katniss and Peeta are the only tributes still alive.</p>
    <p>The cannon sounds, the muttations disappear.</p>
    <p>Katniss and Peeta climb down from the Cornucopia. They think

    <p>Suddenly, there is an announcement from Claudius Templesmith.

    <p><strong>There can be only 1 winner.</strong></p>

                go</span></strong> <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">home,
                not really. I’ll spend the rest of my life in this arena trying to

    <p>They are taken to the Training Center.</p>

    <p>She prepares for the Closing Ceremony of the 74th Hunger

    <p>&nbsp;Cinna dresses Katniss in a simple dress for the Closing
        Ceremony.</p>

    <p>When Katniss asks Cinna why her dress is so simple, Cinna
        responds that Peeta will like the dress.</p>
    <p>Katniss is becoming suspicious. She knows Cinna must be dressing

        <span style="color: dodgerblue;"><strong>“I thought it’d be

                reminder the&nbsp;Games are not quite finished. And beneath his

                around my musty holding space, and he seems to make&nbsp;a
                decision. “But nothing. How about a hug for luck?”&nbsp;Okay,
                that’s an odd request from Haymitch but, after all, we are victors.
                Maybe&nbsp;a hug for luck is in order. Only, when I put my arms
                around his neck, I find myself&nbsp;trapped in his embrace. He
                begins talking, very fast, very quietly in my ear, my&nbsp;hair

                (356-357).&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
    <p>The Capitol is furious with Peeta and Katniss for "showing them
        up" and their rebellion in the Games</p>
    <p>Haymitch emphasizes that their only defense is that Peeta and
        Katniss are madly in love with each other</p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;"><strong>“Your only defense can
                be you were so madly in love you weren’t responsible&nbsp;for your

                hairband.</strong></span></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;"><strong>“Got it,sweetheart?” He
                could be talking about anything now.</strong></span><br>
        <span style="color: dodgerblue;"><strong>“Got it,” I say. “Did you
                tell Peeta this?”</strong></span><br>
        <span style="color: dodgerblue;"><strong>“Don’t have to,” says
                Haymitch. “He’s already there.” (357).&nbsp;</strong></span><br>

    <p><strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"When I left the arena,
                when the trumpets played, I was supposed to be safe. From&nbsp;then

                he’s got no&nbsp;reason to lie, I’ve never been in such a dangerous
                place in my life.&nbsp;It’s so much worse than being hunted in the

    <p>President Snow, the President of Panem, places a crow on Peeta

    <p>Though President Snow is smiling at them, Katniss can see his

    <p>Katniss wants to speak to Peeta privately, but Haymitch won't
        let her.</p>
    <p>That night Katniss tries to sneak out of her room to see Peeta,
        but discovers she has been locked in her room.</p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;"><strong>"I find my own bedroom

                (365).<br></strong></span>
    </p>
    <p>The next day Katniss and Peeta are interviewed again by Caesar
        Flickerman.</p>
    <p>Flickerman asks Katniss about when she realized she loved Peeta
        and she stumbles over an answer.</p>
    <p>Flickerman comes to Katniss' rescue and supplies the answer for
        her in the form of a question.</p>
    <p><span style="color: black;"><img

    <p><strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"When did you realize
                you were in love with him?”</span></strong> <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">asks
                Caesar.</span></strong><br>
        <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">“Oh, that’s a hard one . .
                .” I give a faint, breathy laugh and look down at
                my</span></strong> <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">hands.
                Help.</span></strong><br>
        <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">“Well, I know when it hit
                me. The night when you shouted out his name from</span></strong>
        <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">that tree,” says
                Caesar.</span></strong><br>
        <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">Thank you, Caesar! I
                think, and then go with his idea.“Yes, I guess that was
                it.</span></strong><br>
        <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">I mean, until that point,
                I just tried not to think about what my feelings might
                be,</span></strong><br>
        <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">honestly, because it was
                so confusing and it only made things worse if I
                actually</span></strong><br>
        <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">cared about him. But then,
                in the tree, everything changed,” I say.</span></strong><br>
        <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">“Why do you think that
                was?” urges Caesar.</span></strong><br>
        <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">“Maybe . . . because for
                the first time . . . there was a chance I could
                keep</span></strong><br>
        <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">him,” I say"
                (368).</span></strong>
    </p>
    <p>During the interview, Flickerman asks Peeta about his "new
        leg".</p>
    <p>This is when Katniss learns that Peeta's leg was amputated and
        he now has a prosthetic leg.</p>
    <p><strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"When Caesar asks Peeta
                how his “new leg” is working out.</span></strong><br>
        <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">“New leg?” I say, and I
                can’t help reaching out and pull ing up the bottom
                of</span></strong><br>
        <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">Peeta’s pants. “Oh, no,” I
                whisper, taking in the metal-and-plastic device that
                has</span></strong><br>
        <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">replaced his
                flesh.</span></strong><br>
        <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">“No one told you?” asks
                Caesar gently. I shake my head.</span></strong><br>
        <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">“I haven’t had the
                chance,” says Peeta with a slight shrug.</span></strong><br>
        <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">“It’s my fault,” I say.
                “Because I used that tourniquet.”</span></strong><br>
        <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">“Yes, it’s your fault I’m
                alive,” says Peeta.</span></strong><br>
        <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">“He’s right,” says Caesar.
                “He’d have bled to death for sure without it.”
                (369)<br></span></strong>
    </p>
    <p>When Caesar Flickerman asks Katniss about eating the nightlock
        berries, she knows she must give the "right" answer.</p>
    <p><strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">“Katniss, I know you’ve
                had a shock, but I’ve got to ask. The moment when
                you</span></strong><br>
        <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">pulled out those berries.
                What was going on in your mind . . . hm?” he
                says.</span></strong><br>
        <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">I take a long pause before
                I answer, trying to collect my thoughts. This is
                the</span></strong><br>
        <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">crucial moment where I
                either challenged the Capitol or went so crazy at the
                idea</span></strong><br>
        <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">of losing Peeta that I
                can’t be held responsible for my actions. It seems to call for
                a</span></strong><br>
        <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">big, dramatic speech, but
                all I get out is one almost inaudible sentence. “I
                don’t</span></strong><br>
        <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">know, I just . . .
                couldn’t bear the thought of . . . being without him.”
                (369).<br></span></strong>
    </p>
    <p>After the interview, Haymitch assures Katniss that she did
        well.</p>
    <p>When Katniss returns to her room there is nothing left except
        the mockinjay pin Madge gave her when she left for the Games.</p>
    <p>Finally, while Katniss and Peeta take the train home to District
        12, she begins to think of her home, her family and Gale.</p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;"><strong>"I begin to think of
                home. Of Prim and my mother. Of Gale. I excuse myself to change out
                of my dress and into a plain shirt and pants.</strong></span><br>
        <span style="color: dodgerblue;"><strong>As I slowly, thoroughly
                wash the makeup from my face and put my hair in its
                braid,</strong></span><br>
        <span style="color: dodgerblue;"><strong>I begin transforming back
                into myself. Katniss Everdeen. A girl who lives in
                the</strong></span><br>

                Trades in the Hob. I stare in the mirror as I try
                to</strong></span><br>
        <span style="color: dodgerblue;"><strong>remember who I am and who
                I am not. By the time I join the others, the
                pressure</strong></span><br>
        <span style="color: dodgerblue;"><strong>of Peeta’s arm around my
                shoulders feels alien" (371).</strong></span>
    </p>
    <p>On the train, in front of Peeta, Haymitch reminds Katniss to
        keep up the young lovers act until they are safely home and away
        from all the cameras of the Hunger Games.</p>
    <p>Peeta is furious and asks Katniss is everything between them has
        been just an act.</p>
    <p><strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">“It was all for the
                Games,” Peeta says. “How you acted.”</span></strong><br>
        <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">“Not all of it,” I say,
                tightly holding onto my flowers.</span></strong><br>
        <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">“Then how much? No, forget
                that. I guess the real question is what’s going
                to</span></strong><br>
        <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">be left when we get home?”
                he says.</span></strong><br>
        <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">“I don’t know. The closer
                we get to District Twelve, the more confused I get,”
                I</span></strong><br>
        <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">say. He waits, for further
                explanation, but none’s forthcoming.</span></strong><br>
        <strong><span style="color: dodgerblue;">“Well, let me know when
                you work it out,” he says, and the pain in his voice is palpable"
                (373).</span></strong>
    </p>
    <p>AS Peeta and Katniss depart from the train in District 12, he
        grabs her hand and announces they will pretend one more time.</p>
    <p>Katniss is afraid to let go of Peeta.</p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;"><strong>"Out of the corner of
                my eye, I see Peeta extend his hand. I look at him,
                unsure.</strong></span><br>
        <span style="color: dodgerblue;"><strong>“One more time? For the
                audience?” he says. His voice isn’t angry. It’s
                hollow,</strong></span><br>
        <span style="color: dodgerblue;"><strong>which is worse. Already
                the boy with the bread is slipping away from

        <span style="color: dodgerblue;"><strong>I take his hand, holding
                on tightly, preparing for the cameras, and dreading
                the</strong></span><br>
        <span style="color: dodgerblue;"><strong>moment when I will finally
