        	<span><span ><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TEENAGERS DON&rsquo;T WANT TO LIVE BY THE RULES</span></strong></p>
<p>Mr. Spencer tells Holden,&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>"Life is a game, boy. Life is a game that one plays according to the rules.&rdquo; (Page 8)</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TEENS FALL IN LOVE EASILY</span></strong></p>
<p>Sees Sally.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"I felt like marrying her the minute I saw her. I'm crazy. I didn't even like her much, and yet all of a sudden I felt like I was in love with her and wanted to marry her. I swear to God I'm crazy. I admit it. (Page 124)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TEENS LIE</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the most terrific liar you ever saw in your life. It&rsquo;s awful.&rdquo; (page 16)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GIRLS DATE THE BAD BOYS</span></strong></p>
<p>Holden decides girls make excuses that boys feel inferior so they can date arrogant guys.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"It's a funny thing about girls. Every time you mention some guy that's strictly a bastard--very mean,or conceited and all--and when you mention it to the girl, she'll tell you he has an inferiority complex." (Page 135)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CONCERNED ABOUT HAVING TO GO TO WAR</span></strong></p>
<p>The movie Holden watched was about the Army. Holden says he would never join the military.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"I swear if there's another war, they better just take me out and stick me in front of a firing squad...Anyway, I sort of glad they've got the atomic bomb invented. If there's ever another war, I'm going to sit right the hell on top of it. I'll volunteer for it, I swear to God I will. (Page 141</span>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INTERESTED IN SEX</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"Innarested in a little tail t'night?" (Page 91)</span></p>
<p>Carl Luce was an expert on sex at the Whooten School.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"Old Luce. what a guy. He was supposed to be my Student Adviser when I was at Whooten. The only thing he ever did, though, was give these sex talks and all, late at night when there was a bunch of guys in his room. He knew quite a bit about sex, especially perverts and all." (Page 143)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GETTING DRUNK</span></strong></p>
<p>Holden gets very, very drunk after Carl Luce leaves the Wicker Bar.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"Boy, I sat at that goddam&nbsp; bar till around one o'clock or so, getting drunk as a bastard...I could hardly see straight " (Page 150)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"When I'm drunk I'm a madman." (Page 151)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TEENS POOR SELF ESTEEM</span></strong></p>
<p>Holden feels he is the dumb one in his family.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"I'm the only really dumb one." (Page 67)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TEENS GET CRUSHES </span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Holden becomes obsessed with memories of Jane Gallagher.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">&nbsp;"All of a sudden, on my way out to the lobby, I got old Jane Gallagher on the brain again." (Page 76)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"I know old Jane like a book--I still couldn't get her off&nbsp; my brain. I knew her like a book." (Page 76)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TEENAGERS CAN BE OVERLY EMOTIONAL</span></strong></p>
<p>Holden repeatedly states in Chapter 7 that he is depressed and lonesome.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"I got up and went over and looked out the window, I felt so lonesome. I almost wished I was dead." (Page 48)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"Boy, did I feel rotten. I felt so damm lonesome." (Page 48)</span></p>
<p>1. Begins to cry</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"I was crying and all. I don't know why.&nbsp; But I was. I guess it was because I was feeling so damn depressed and lonesome." (Page 153)</span></p>
<p>Holden is upset and crying right before he leaves.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"Then, all of a sudden, I started to cry. I couldn't help it. I did it so nobody could hear me, but I did it. It scared the hell out of Phoebe when I started doing it., and she came over and tried to make me stop, but once you get started, you can't just stop on a goddam dime." (Page 179)</span></p>
<p>Holden meets Phoebe on the steps of the museum and they argue, because she wants to run away with him.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"I was almost all set to hit her. I thought I was going to smack her for a second. I really did...I wanted her to cry till her eyes were practically dropped out. I almost hated her." (Page 207)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SNEAKING INTO THE HOUSE</span></strong></p>
<p>Holden decides to go home to see Phoebe one last time, in case he dies of pnuemonia.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">&nbsp;"Finally what I figured I'd do, I figured I'd better sneak home and see her, in case I died and all. (Page 156)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TEENS ARE AFRAID THEY WILL GET IN TROUBLE WITH THEIR PARENTS</span></strong></p>
<p>Phoebe keeps telling Holden their father will kill Holden when he finds out that he has been kicked out of another school.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"You did get kicked out! You did...Daddy'll kill you...Daddy's gonna kill you!" (Page 165)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TEENS HATE SCHOOL </span></strong></p>
<p>Holden tells Phoebe that she doesn't understand how much he hates school and all the phonies.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"It was one of the worst schools I ever went to, It was full of phonies. And mean guys. You never saw so many mean guys in your life." (Page 167)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"You can't trust anybody in a goddam school." (Page 201)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TEEN SUICIDE</span></strong></p>
<p>Daydreams about James Castle, a boy he knew at the Elkton School who committed suicide by jumping out a window because he was being bullied at Elkton School.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"Old James Castle...he jumped out the window. He was dead, and his teeth, and his blood were all over the place, and nobody would even go near him...All they did with the guys that were in the room with him was expel them. They didn't even go to jail." (Page 170)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TEENS HAVE A HARD TIME STAYING FOCUSED</span></strong></p>
<p>Holden stops listening to Phoebe.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"I couldn't concentrate too hot. Sometimes it's hard to concentrate." (Page 169)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TEENS OFTEN HAVE UNREALISTIC IDEAS ABOUT THE FUTURE</span></strong></p>
<p>Holden tells Phoebe he wants to be "the catcher in the rye"</p>
<p>He imagines a huge rye field where he will protect children from falling off the edge of a cliff. "If a body catch a body comin' through the rye"</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"You'd know what I'd like to be? I mean if I had my goddam choice?...That's all I'd do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all. I know it's crazy, but that's the only thing I'd&nbsp; really like to be. I know it's crazy." (Page 173)</span></p>
<p>Holden imagines living in a house in the woods and getting married.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"I'd build a little cabin somewhere...right near the woods, but not in them, because I'd want it to be sunny...I'd meet this beautiful girl that was also a deaf-mute and we'd get married." (Page 199)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TEENS RARELY EVER HAVE ENOUGH MONEY</span></strong></p>
<p>He is running out of money and borrows Phoebe's "Christmas money" $8.65.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"Listen. You got any dough, Phoebe? I'm practically broke."(Page )</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TEENS OFTEN DON&rsquo;T CARE</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"I didn't give much of a damn any more if they caught me. I really didn't. I figured if they caught me, they caught me. I almost wish they did, in a way. (Page 180)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ADULTS GIVE ADVICE&mdash;TEENS IGNORE IT</span></strong></p>
<p>Mr. Antolini is worried about Holden and tries to give him advice, but Holden is too tired to listen to him.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"Frankly, I don't know what the hell to say to you Holden. I have a feeling that you're riding for some kind of a terrible, terrible fall. But I don't honestly know what kind...Are you listening to me? (page 186)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TEENS WORRY ABOUT PERVERTS</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"Boy, I was shaking like a madman. I was sweating, too. When something perverty like that happens, I start sweating like a bastard. That kind of stuff's happened to me about twenty times since I was a kid. I can't stand it." (Page 193)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TEENS WORRY ABOUT THEIR APPEARANCE/HEALTH</span></strong></p>
<p>He reads a magazine at the train station and it depresses him because the articles are about hormones and cancer.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"I started reading...I looked exactly like the guy in the article with lousy hormones. So I started getting worried about my hormones." (Page 195)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"I'd had this sore on the inside of my lip for about two weeks. so I figured I was getting cancer." (Page 196)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TEENS ARE UNSURE ABOUT THE FUTURE</span></strong></p>
<p>Holden is tired of people asing him if he is better and will "apply himself" in school.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"It's such a stupid question, in my opinion. I mean how do you know wht you're going to do till you do it? The answer is, you don't. I think I am, but how do I know? I swear it's a stupid question." (Page 213)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Counter Argument</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Holden&rsquo;s family is incredibly rich</span></strong></p>
<p>Holden checks his wallet for money and reveals to the reader that</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">&nbsp;"I'm a goddam spendthrift at heart. What I don't spend, I lose. &ldquo;(Page 107)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Holden talks about his dad.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"> "My father's quite wealthy...He's a corporation lawyer...he's always investing money in show on Broadway." (Page 107)</span></p>
<p>Holden goes on a rant about the nuns' cheap suitcases and mentions that his roommate, Dick Slagele, from the Elkton Hills School had cheap suitcase.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="color: #ff0000;">&rdquo;I hate it when somebody has cheap suitcases...It depressed the holy hell out of me." (Page 108)</span></p>

<p>Vacation for the whole summer in Maine</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">HOLDEN IS IN RE-HAB</span></strong></p>
<p>Main Character Holden Caulfield is at a psychiatric hospital or "rest home" and he begins to explain why he thinks he is there.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to tell you my whole goddamn autobiography or anything. I&rsquo;ll just tell you about this madman stuff that happened to me around last Christmas just before I got pretty run-down and had to come out her and take it easy.&rdquo; (Page 1)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">HOLDEN GOING BARS AND DRINKING</span></strong></p>
<p>Holden goes to the bar at the hotel.</p>
<p>He tries to buy drinks but the waiter refuses to serve him.</p>
<p>Holden dances with 3 girls at the next table, but he clearly does not like them.</p>
<p>Going to the nightclub depresses him.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"There isn't a nightclub in the world you can sit in for a long time unless you can at least buy some liquor and get drunk. Or unless you're with some girl that really knocks you out." (Page 76)</span></p>
<p>Holden gets very, very drunk after Carl Luce leaves the Wicker Bar.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"Boy, I sat at that goddam&nbsp; bar till around one o'clock or so, getting drunk as a bastard...I could hardly see straight " (Page 150)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">HOLDEN HAS EXPERIENCED SEVERAL DEATHS</span></strong></p>
<p>Allie died from leukemia when he was 11 years old (July 18, 1946)</p>
<p>Holden is 2 years older than Allie, he was 13 when his brother died.</p>
<p>Holden describes Allie as intelligent, with red hair and</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"it wasn't just that he was the most intelligent member of the family. He was also the nicest, in lots of ways." (Page 38)</span></p>
<p>Daydreams about James Castle, a boy he knew at the Elkton School who committed suicide by jumping out a window because he was being bullied at Elkton School.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"Old James Castle...he jumped out the window. He was dead, and his teeth, and his blood were all over the place, and nobody would even go near him...All they did with the guys that were in the room with him was expel them. They didn't even go to jail." (Page 170)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">HOLDEN&rsquo;S RELATIONSHIPS WITH HIS TEACHERS</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 2 (Pages 6-16) "Life is game, Holden doesn't want to play by the rules"</span></strong></p>
<p>Holden goes to visit one of his teachers Mr. Spencer.</p>
<p>Mr. Spencer is old. He has the flu. Holden flunked his history class.</p>
<p>Mr. Spencer tells Holden,&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">"Life is a game, boy. Life is a game that one plays according to the rules.&rdquo; (Page 8</span>)</em></p>
<p>Holden likes and respects Mr. Spencer but leaves his house when Mr. Spencer begins to lecture him about life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 24 (Pages 180-193) "Mr. Antolini warns Holden he is headed for a fall"</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /> </span></strong>Holden goes to Mr. Antolini's apartment. The Antolini's have just had a dinner party and the place is a mess.</p>
<p>Holden notices that Mrs. Antolini is much older that Mr. Antolini.</p>
<p>Mr. Antolini&nbsp; had obviously been drinking, and he continues to drink.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">HOLDEN HAS BEEN BEATEN UP SEVERAL TIMES</span></strong></p>
<p>They fight and Stradlater has to hold Holden down and ends up punching him in the face to get Holden to shut up.</p>
<p>After the fight, Holden tells the reader,</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"I had blood all over my mouth and chin and even on my pajamas and bathrobe. It parly scared me and it party fascinated me." (Page 45)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 14 (Pages 98-104) "Sunny and Maurice shake down Holden for more cash"</span></strong></p>
<p>Holden is in his pajamas in bed, when Sunny and the elevator operator, Maurice come to his room.</p>
<p>Sunny and Maurice insist that Holden give them more money, another $5.</p>
