<p>Sees Sally.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"I felt like marrying her the minute I saw
        her. I'm crazy. I didn't even like her much, and yet all of a sudden
        I felt like I was in love with her and wanted to marry her. I swear
        to God I'm crazy. I admit it. (Page 124)</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GIRLS DATE THE BAD
            BOYS</span></strong></p>
<p>Holden decides girls make excuses that boys feel inferior so they can
    date arrogant guys.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"It's a funny thing about girls. Every time
        you mention some guy that's strictly a bastard--very mean,or
        conceited and all--and when you mention it to the girl, she'll tell
        you he has an inferiority complex." (Page 135)</span></p>

<p>The movie Holden watched was about the Army. Holden says he would never
    join the military.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"I swear if there's another war, they
        better just take me out and stick me in front of a firing
        squad...Anyway, I sort of glad they've got the atomic bomb invented.
        If there's ever another war, I'm going to sit right the hell on top
        of it. I'll volunteer for it, I swear to God I will. (Page

        (Page 91)</span></p>
<p>Carl Luce was an expert on sex at the Whooten School.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"Old Luce. what a guy. He was supposed to
        be my Student Adviser when I was at Whooten. The only thing he ever
        did, though, was give these sex talks and all, late at night when
        there was a bunch of guys in his room. He knew quite a bit about

        depressed and lonesome." (Page 153)</span></p>
<p>Holden is upset and crying right before he leaves.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"Then, all of a sudden, I started to cry. I
        couldn't help it. I did it so nobody could hear me, but I did it. It
        scared the hell out of Phoebe when I started doing it., and she came
        over and tried to make me stop, but once you get started, you can't
        just stop on a goddam dime." (Page 179)</span></p>
<p>Holden meets Phoebe on the steps of the museum and they argue, because
    she wants to run away with him.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"I was almost all set to hit her. I thought

    at Elkton School.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"Old James Castle...he jumped out the
        window. He was dead, and his teeth, and his blood were all over the
        place, and nobody would even go near him...All they did with the
        guys that were in the room with him was expel them. They didn't even

</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"You'd know what I'd like to be? I mean if
        I had my goddam choice?...That's all I'd do all day. I'd just be the
        catcher in the rye and all. I know it's crazy, but that's the only
        thing I'd&nbsp; really like to be. I know it's crazy." (Page
        173)</span></p>
<p>Holden imagines living in a house in the woods and getting married.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"I'd build a little cabin somewhere...right
        near the woods, but not in them, because I'd want it to be
        sunny...I'd meet this beautiful girl that was also a deaf-mute and
        we'd get married." (Page 199)</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"I didn't give much of a damn any more if
        they caught me. I really didn't. I figured if they caught me, they
        caught me. I almost wish they did, in a way. (Page 180)</span></p>

    Holden is too tired to listen to him.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"Frankly, I don't know what the hell to say
        to you Holden. I have a feeling that you're riding for some kind of
        a terrible, terrible fall. But I don't honestly know what kind...Are

            PERVERTS</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"Boy, I was shaking like a madman. I was
        sweating, too. When something perverty like that happens, I start
        sweating like a bastard. That kind of stuff's happened to me about

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TEENS ARE UNSURE ABOUT
            THE FUTURE</span></strong></p>
<p>Holden is tired of people asing him if he is better and will "apply
    himself" in school.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"It's such a stupid question, in my
        opinion. I mean how do you know wht you're going to do till you do
        it? The answer is, you don't. I think I am, but how do I know? I
        swear it's a stupid question." (Page 213)</span></p>

<p>Holden dances with 3 girls at the next table, but he clearly does not

<p>Going to the nightclub depresses him.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"There isn't a nightclub in the world you
