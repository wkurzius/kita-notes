    <h1><strong><span style="color: black;">Bradbury purposely does not
                say where and when the story takes place. He wants the
                reader(that's you) to imagine the story taking place where you
                live, in your town. This makes a stronger connection between the

    <p><strong>The technicians are NOT doctors.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>In Montag's world there are too many overdoses for
