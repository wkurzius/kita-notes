<p>Gr. 8-12. His name is Troy, but to the world--and in his
internal dialogues--he is the Fat Kid. Really Fat. Almost 300
pounds of sweating, unhappy insecurity. Then out of a moment of
despair comes magic. As Troy considers whether to splatter himself
on a subway track, Curt MacCrae, a charismatic punk rocker/homeless
kid/dropout, comes along and stops him. For the price of a meal,
Curt befriends Troy, and he sees something under all those layers:
a potential musician, a friend, and someone with the ability to see
through life's bull. First-time novelist Going has put together an
amazing assortment of characters. Troy is the ultimate fat kid, the
kind whose every move, every thought is predicated on what it is
like to wear a coat of blubber. Curt, as thin as Troy is fat, is a
combination of Kurt Cobain, Ratso Rizzo, and a fairy godfather. He
sprinkles Troy with the dirt and grime of punk rock and brings out
the prince hiding inside the weight (to the book's credit, Troy
doesn't get any thinner). Equally well drawn are the lesser
characters, including Troy's father, a former Marine with an innate
sense of what kids need. The narrative could have been tighter in
places, but this is an impressive debut that offers hope for all
kids--gross transmuted into gold.</p>

adults want or expect them to do. Troy always tries to do what his
