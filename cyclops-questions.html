    <h1>1. What gift does Odysseus take with him when he goes to see
        the Cyclops? How dows this gift end up saving the lives of Odysseus
        and his men?</h1>
    <h2>Odysseus has brough a gift of liquor (wine/brandy) with him to
        the Cyclops' island. Odysseus uses the wine to get the Cyclops
        drunk. Odysseus blinds the Cyclops while he is drunk and is able to
        escape his cave.</h2>
    <h2><span style="color: indigo;">"this liquor...of brandy, pure and
            fiery....they would put one cupful--ruby-colored,</span></h2>
    <h2><span style="color: indigo;">honey-smooth--in twenty more of
            water,</span></h2>
    <h2><span style="color: indigo;">but still the sweet scent hovered
            like a fume</span></h2>
    <h2><span style="color: indigo;">over the winebowl"
            (127-133).</span></h2>
    <h1>2. What technique does the Cylcops use to control the passage
        of sheep in and out of his cave? Why does this technique prvent
        Odysseus and his men from safely killing the Cyclops?</h1>
    <h2>The Cyclops closes the mouth to his cave with a huge boulder,
        that only the giant monster can move. If Odysseus kills the Cylcops
        in the cave, he and his men will be trapped inside the cave and die
        anyway.</h2>
    <h2>"he swung high overhead a slab of solid rock to close the cave.
        Two dozen four-wheeled wagons, with heaving wagon teams, could not
        have stirred the tonnage of that rock from where he wedged it over
        the doorstill" (166-171).</h2>
    <h1>3. What god does Odysseus invoke as he asks the Cyclops for a
        gift? Why is this god appropriate?</h1>
    <h2>Odysseus invokes the name of Zeus when he asks the Cyclops for
        hospitality. This is appropriate because Zeus is the king of the
        gods, the most powerful god and respected and FEARED by all. The
        Greeks believed that Zeus would punish anyone who does not offer
        hospitality.</h2>
    <h2><span style="color: indigo;">"It was our luck to come here;
            here we stand,</span></h2>
    <h2><span style="color: indigo;">beholden for your help, or any
            gifts</span></h2>

    <h2><span style="color: indigo;">We would entreat you, great Sir,
            have a care</span></h2>
    <h2><span style="color: indigo;">for the gods' courtesy; Zeus will
            avenvge</span></h2>
    <h2><span style="color: indigo;">the unoffending guest" (Lines
            194-197).</span></h2>
    <h1>4. Why does Odysseus lie and say that his ship was smashed when
        the Cyclops asks its location?</h1>
    <h2>Odysseus lies because he is afraid the Cyclops will destroy his
        ship, kill his men and eliminate their only means of escape from
        the island. Odysseus is being cunning.</h2>
    <h2><span style="color: indigo;">"Tell me, where was it, now, you
            left your ship--</span></h2>
    <h2><span style="color: indigo;">around the point, or down the

    <h2><span style="color: indigo;">He thought he'd find out, but I

            lie.</span></h2>
    <h2><span style="color: indigo;">My ship?</span></h2>
    <h2><span style="color: indigo;">Poseidon Lord, who sets the earth
            a-tremble,</span></h2>

            land's end.</span></h2>

    <h2><span style="color: indigo;">We are survivors, these good men
            and I"&nbsp; (Lines 207-214)</span></h2>
    <h1>5. What does the Cyclops do to 2 of Odysseus' men? Why is this
        action particularly ironic given the Greek customs of the "laws of
        hospitality"?</h1>
    <h2>Cyclops captures and eats 2 of the men for dinner. This is
        ironic because in the Greek culture hospitality is greatly admired.
        The Cyclops should be giving Odysseus and his men dinner not making
        them his dinner.</h2>
    <h2><span style="color: indigo;">"He clutched at my
            companions</span></h2>

            hide their wooden stake in the cave? How many</span> men does it
        take to pick up this huge stake?</h1>
    <h2>They hide the stake in a pile of feces in the back of the cave.
        It takes a total of 5 men to pick up the stake.</h2>
    <h2><span style="color: indigo;">"I hewed again to make a stake
            with a pinted end. I held this</span></h2>
    <h2><span style="color: indigo;">in the fire's heart and turned it,

            the Cyclops drink? Why is thiw wine particularly
            potent?</span></h1>
    <h2><span style="color: black;">The Cyclops drinks a total of 4
            bowls of wine. The wine is very potent because it is nectar and

                Cyclops' name is Polyphemus. When the other one-eyed giants ask who
                has hurt Polyphemus he replies "No body" and they leave. Odysseus
