                <h2>Major Characters</h2>
                <p><strong><em>George Milton<br></em></strong> The protagonist and
                    main character of the book. He is a caring, compassionate, and
                    understanding human being who dreams of owning his own piece of
                    land " 'an live offa the fat of the land". Physically, he is a
                    small and intelligent man with strong features. He is Lennie's
                    cousin. He made a promise to Lennie's mother when she died to take
                    of Lennie.&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong><em>Lennie Small<br></em></strong> The obedient friend
                    of George. He has a child’s mind and a giant’s body. Ironically,
                    Lennie Small is a big, strong man. He is mentally retarded, and
                    relies upon George. It is these contrasting qualities and his
                    impulsive nature that cause him problems. Lennie is basically
                    harmless, but he does not understand his own strength. He loves to
                    pet soft things, like mice and puppies, but often kills them
                    accidently if they "nip" at him.</p>

                <p><strong><em>Old Candy<br></em></strong> One of the lonely ranch

                    discriminated against because he is handicapped and now he is
                    getting old. Candy is worried he will lose his job and home when he
                    gets to old to work.</p>
                <p><strong><em>Crooks<br></em></strong> A black ranch hand. He is
                    sensible and neat, with a mind of his own. He is a lonely
                    character, who is discriminated against, due to his race. However,
                    Crooks has a skill. He is knowledgeable about farm animals. Crooks
                    lives alone because he is Black. He does not live witht he other

                    short. He has a Napoleonic Complex because he is short, he is
                    always trying to prove himself by fighting with others.</p>
                <p><strong><em>Curley’s wife<br></em></strong> The only woman on
                    the ranch. She is very flirtatious. Notice she does NOT have a name
                    other than Curley's wife. Woman are discriminated against at this
                    time in American history. She has no identity other than Curley's

                    Candy’s words). He is more concerned about his work on the ranch
                    than anyone else. He is fair. The Boss is respected because he is
                    rich.</p>

                <p><strong>CHAPTER 1 (pages 1-18) "Meeting George and
                        Lennie"<br></strong></p>
                <p><strong>The purpose of chapter 1 is to introduce the setting of
                        the novel and the main char</strong><strong>acters George and
                        Lennie.</strong><strong><br></strong></p>
                <p><strong><br></strong><strong>George and Lennie are on their way
                        to a ranch to get jobs. They stop near the Salinas River. They will
                        eat dinner and camp out by the river and go to the ranch the next
                        day.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
                <p><strong>The readers learn that George "takes care of Lennie" and
                        George is frustrated. Because George takes care of Lennie, he has
                        sacrificed his own life, dreams and any chance of
                        success.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Lennie is revealed to be a huge man, but he is
                        developmentally disabled. Lennie has a habit of carrying a mouse in
                        his pocket to pet it. When the mouse nips at Lennie's fingers, he
                        crushes its skull. George has to make Lennie throw the mouse
                        away.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
                <p><strong>It is revealed that George and Lennie had to sneak out
                        of the town of Weed because Lennie got in trouble when he tried to
                        "touch" a woman's dress. The dress was soft and Lennie wanted to
                        rub fabric in his hands.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
                <p><strong>George insists that Lennie remember this place by the
                        river in case he gets in trouble again. As Lennie and George fall
                        asleep they talk about their version of the American Dream, to own
                        their own ranch some day and live off the fat of the
                        land.<br></strong></p>

                <p>In chapter 1 the <strong>setting</strong> of the story is
                    revealed to the reader.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The story takes place on a ranch in the Salinas River Valley in

                    <li>The story takes place during the Great Depression.</li>
                    <li>Many men are out of work and the farming industry in the
                        Midwestern United States is suffering.</li>
                    <li>Men are working as migrant farm workers, traveling from farm to

                <p>George Milton</p>
                <p>"was small and quick, dark of face, with restless eyes and
                    sharp, strong features. Every part of him was defined: small,
                    strong hands, slender arms, a thin and bony nose" (2).</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Lennie Small (he is often described and compared to an
                    animal)</p>
                <p>"Behind him walked his opposite, a huge man, shapeless of face,
                    with large pale eyes, with wide sloping shoulders; and he walked
                    heavily, dragging his feet a little, <em>the way a bear drags his
                        paws</em>. His arms did not swing at his sides, but hung
                    loosely...he drank from the surface of the green pool with long
                    gulps, <em>snorting into the water like a horse</em>" (2).</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>"Lennie <em>dabbled his big paw</em> in the water and wiggled

                <p>"slowly <em>like a terrier</em> who doesn't want to bring a ball

                <p>"George lay back on the sand and crossed his hands under his
                    head, and Lennie imitated him, raising his head to see whether he
                    were doing it right" (7).</p>

                    come to a ranch an' work up a stake and then they go inta a town
                    and blow their stake, and the first thing you know they're pounding
                    their tail on some other ranch. They ain't got nothing to look
                    ahead to . . . With us it ain’t like that. We got a future. We got
                    somebody to talk to that gives a damn about us. We don’t have to
                    sit in no bar room blowin’ in our jack jus’ because we got no place
                    else to go. If them other guys gets in jail they can rot for all

                    Go on George! Tell about what we're gonna have in the garden and
                    about the rabbits in the cages and about the rain in the winter and
                    the stove, and how thick the cream is on the milk like you can
                    hardly cut it. Tell about that, George...Well, said George, we'll
                    have a big vegetable patch and a rabbit hutch and chickens. And
                    when it rains in the winter, we'll just say the hell with goin' to
                    work, and we'll build up a fire in the stove and set around it an'
                    listen to the rain comin' down on the roof...When we get the coupla
                    acres I can let you tend the rabbits all right...Let's have
                    different color rabbits, George. Sure we will. Red and blue and
                    green rabbits, Lennie. Millions of 'em. Furry ones, George, like I

                    even twenty mules with a single line to the leaders. He was capable
                    of killing a fly on the wheeler's butt with a bull whip without
                    touching the mule. There was a gravity in his manner and a quiet so

                    Candy to shoot his old dog and give him one of the pups to raise
                    up? I can smell that dog a mile away. Got no teeth, damn near

                <p>"Say, you sure was right about him. Maybe he ain't bright, but I
                    never seen such a worker. He damn near killed his partner buckin'
                    barley. There ain't nobody can keep up with him. God awmighty I
                    never seen such a strong guy. " (43).</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>"George spoke proudly. "Jus' tell Lennie what to do an' he'll do
                    it if it don't take no figuring. He can't think of nothing to do
                    himself, but he sure can take orders... "He ain't no cuckoo, " said
                    George. "He's dumb as hell, but he ain't crazy" (43).</p>

                <p>During the Great Depression it was very unusual for men to be
                    friends, travel together and look out for each other.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>George and Lennie go around together.</li>

                    <li>George explains his unusual relationship with Lennie</li>
                    <li>George and Lennie grew up in the same town. When Lennie's aunt
                        dies, George begins to take care of him.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>"Funny how you an' him string along together...Hardly none of
                    the guys ever travel together. I hardly never seen two guys travel
                    together...Never seem to give a damn about nobody. It jus' seems
                    kinda funny a cuckoo like him and a smart little guy like you
                    travelin' together...</p>
                <p>George said at last. "Him and me was both born in Auburn. I
                    knowed his Aunt Clara. She took him when he was a baby and raised
                    him up. When his Aunt Clara died, Lennie just come along with me
                    out workin'. Got kinda used to each other after a little while"
                    (44).</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>George explains to Slim that he used to make fun of Lennie's
                    disability but stopped because he almost killed Lennie.</p>
                <p>Lennie trusts George completely.</p>
                <p>"Funny, " said George. "I used to have a hell of a lot of fun
                    with 'im. Used to play jokes on 'im 'cause he was too dumb to take
                    care of 'imself. But he was too dumb even to know he had a joke
                    played on him. I had fun. Made me seem God damn smart alongside of
                    him...turns to Lennie and says, 'Jump in. ' An' he jumps. Couldn't
                    swim a stroke. He damn near drowned before we could get him. An' he
                    was so damn nice to me for pullin' him out. Clean forgot I told him
                    to jump in. Well, I ain't done nothing like that no more. "</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Slim makes an observation that smart guys are not always nice
                    guys.</p>
                <p>"Guy don't need no sense to be a nice fella. Seems to me
                    sometimes it jus' works the other way around. Take a real smart guy
                    and he ain't hardly ever a nice fella. (45).</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Carlson enters the bunkhouse and begins to complain about

                <ul>
                    <li>Carlson wants to kill the dog because he is crippled.</li>
                    <li>Ironically, Candy is as old and crippled as his dog.</li>
                    <li>Slim agrees with Carlson.</li>
                    <li>Candy reluctantly agrees to let Carlson shoot his dog.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>"I can't stand him in here, " said Carlson. "That stink hangs
                    around even after he's gone. " He walked over with his heavy-
                    legged stride and looked down at the dog. "Got no teeth, " he said.
                    "He's all stiff with rheumatism. He ain't no good to you, Candy.
                    An' he ain't no good to himself. Why'n't you shoot him,
                    Candy?...</p>
                <p>"Look, Candy. This of dog jus' suffers hisself all the time. If
                    you was to take him out and shoot him right in the back of the
                    head-" he leaned over and pointed, "- right there, why he'd never
                    know what hit him...</p>
                <p>Tell you what. I'll shoot him for you. Then it won't be you that
                    does it...</p>
                <p>That dog ain't no good to himself. I wisht somebody'd shoot me
                    if I get old an' a cripple. " (49-50).</p>

                </ul>
                <p>"Candy looked a long time at Slim to try to find some reversal.
                    And Slim gave him none...Candy lay rigidly on his bed staring at
                    the ceiling...Slim said, 'Candy, you can have any one of thme pups
                    you want'...The silence was in the room again. A shot sounded in
                    the distance. The men looked quickly at the old man. Every head
                    turned toward him. For a moment he continued to stare at the
                    ceiling. Then he rolled slowly over and faced the wall and lay
                    silent (54).</p>

                    Curley burst into the room excitedly. "Any you guys seen my

                    When they can me here I wisht somebody'd shoot me. But they won't

                    fix up that little old place an' we'll go live there. " He sat down
                    again. They all sat still, all bemused by the beauty of the thing,

                <p>He slashed at Lennie with his left, and then smashed down his

                    on. "I think you got your han' caught in a machine. If you don't

                        In Chapter 6 the story has come full circle. Lennie and George have
                        returned to the banks of the Salinas River.</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>When Lennie first gets to the river he is proud of
                            himself for remembering George's instructions.<br></strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Lennie has 2 hallucinations at the river.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>In the first hallucination he sees his Aunt Clara, who
                            chastises him for not listening to George and getting in
                            trouble.<br></strong></li>
                    <li><strong>"And then from out of Lennie's head there came a little
                            fat old woman. She wore thick bull's-eye glasses and she wore a
                            huge gingham apron with pockets, and she was starched and clean.
                            She stood in front of Lennie and put her hands on her hips, and she
                            frowned disapprovingly at him. And when she spoke, it was in
                            Lennie's voice. .. "You never give a thought to George, " she went
                            on in Lennie's voice. "He been doin' nice things for you alla time.
                            When he got a piece of pie you always got half or more'n half. An'
                            if they was any ketchup, why he'd give it all to you. " "I know, "
                            said Lennie miserably. "I tried, Aunt Clara, ma'am. I tried and
                            tried" (98).&nbsp;</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>The the second hallucination, a huge rabbit chastises
                            Lennie and tells&nbsp; him that George is angry and will beat

                            bear hell outa you with a stick, that's what he's gonna do"

                    <li><strong>Both hallucinations show Lennie's childlike level of

                    <li><strong>George sits just behind Lennie and "tells how it's

                    <li><strong>George makes Lennie happy talking about their farm and

                <p><strong>"George had been listening to the distant sounds. For a
                        moment he was business-like. "Look acrost the river, Lennie, an'
                        I'll tell you so you can almost see it. " Lennie turned his head
                        and looked off across the pool and up the darkening slopes of the
                        Gabilans. "We gonna get a little place, " George began. He reached
                        in his side pocket and brought out Carlson's Luger; he snapped off
                        the safety, and the hand and gun lay on the ground behind Lennie's
                        back. He looked at the back of Lennie's head, at the place where
                        the spine and skull were joined. A man's voice called from up the
                        river, and an-other man answered. "Go on, " said Lennie. George
                        raised the gun and his hands shook, and he dropped his hand to the
                        ground again" (103).&nbsp;</strong></p>

                            Lennie will die slowly and painfully.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>If Lennie goes to jail he will be locked up like an
                            animal and he will suffer as well.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>George takes Carlson's gun out of his pocket and shoots
                            Lennie.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>George feels the only way he can help Lennie or protect
                            him is a mercy killing. George kills Lennie quickly and painlessly

                <p><strong>"Lennie said, "I thought you was mad at me, George. "

                        I ain't now. That's a thing I want ya to know. " The voices came
                        close now. George raised the gun and listened to the voices. Lennie
                        begged, "Le's do it now. Le's get that place now. " "Sure, right
                        now. I gotta. We gotta. " And George raised the gun and steadied
                        it, and he brought the muzzle of it close to the back of Lennie's
                        head. The hand shook violently, but his face set and his hand
                        steadied. He pulled the trigger. The crash of the shot rolled up
                        the hills and rolled down again" (104).&nbsp;</strong></p>
