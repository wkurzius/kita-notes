    <p>Sherman Alexie tells the story of Junior, a budding cartoonist
        growing up on the Spokane Indian Reservation. Determined to take
        his future into his own hands, Junior leaves his troubled school on
        the rez to attend an all-white farm town high school where the only
        other Indian is the school mascot. Heartbreaking, funny, and
        beautifully written, <em>The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time
            Indian</em>, which is based on the author's own experiences,
        coupled with poignant drawings that reflect the character's art,
        chronicles the contemporary adolescence of one Native American boy
        as he attempts to break away from the life he thought he was
        destined to live.</p>
