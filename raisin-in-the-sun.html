    <p><strong>“A Dream Deferred” by Langston Hughes</strong></p>
    <p><strong>What happens to a dream deferred?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Does it dry up</strong> <strong><br></strong>
        <strong>like a raisin in the sun?</strong> <strong><br></strong>
        <strong>Or fester like a sore--</strong> <strong><br></strong>
        <strong>And then run?</strong> <strong><br></strong> <strong>Does
            it stink like rotten meat?</strong> <strong><br></strong>
        <strong>Or crust and sugar over--</strong> <strong><br></strong>
        <strong>like a syrupy sweet?</strong>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Maybe it just sags</strong> <strong><br></strong>
        <strong>like a heavy load.</strong>
    </p>
    <p><strong><em>Or does it explode?</em></strong></p>
