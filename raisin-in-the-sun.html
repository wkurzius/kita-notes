<p><strong>&ldquo;A Dream Deferred&rdquo; by Langston Hughes</strong></p>
<p><strong>What happens to a dream deferred?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Does it dry up </strong><strong><br /> </strong><strong>like a
        raisin in the sun? </strong><strong><br /> </strong><strong>Or
        fester like a sore-- </strong><strong><br /> </strong><strong>And
        then run? </strong><strong><br /> </strong><strong>Does it stink
        like rotten meat? </strong><strong><br /> </strong><strong>Or crust
        and sugar over-- </strong><strong><br /> </strong><strong>like a
        syrupy sweet?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Maybe it just sags </strong><strong><br /> </strong><strong>like
        a heavy load.</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Or does it explode?</em></strong></p>
