Central Issues</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><br>
On page 16, how does Ishmael describe the moon? How does he compare
it to human behavior?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="color: #0000ff;">"We must strive to be like
the moon...the adage served to remind people to always be on their
best behavior and to be good to others...People complain when there
is too much sun and it gets unbearbly hot, and also when it rains
too much or when it is cold. But no one grumbles when the moon
shines. Everyone becomes happy and appreciates the moon in their
own special way. Children watch their shadows and play in its
light, people gather at the square to tell stories and dance
through the night. A lot of happy things happen when the moon
shines. These are some of the reasons why we should want to be like
the moon." (17)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style=
"color: #000000;">Ismael describes the moon as something people
always like in their own way because the moon gives light to a dark
night, children play in the moon's shadow and tell stories by the
moon light. Ismael notices that people complain about the weather,
the sun, the heat and the cold all the time. People do not complain
about the moon. Ishmael thinks people should be more like the moon
and be happier.</span><br></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style=
"color: #000000;"><strong>Why are child soldiers being recruited?
What are the advantages?</strong><br></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style=
"color: #000000;"><strong><br></strong>Boy soldiers are being
recruited for the Sierra Leone Army and the Rebel Army because
there are so many young boys who are homeless and without a family.
The boys are <span style=
"text-decoration: underline;">looking</span> for a "new family".
These boys want to belong to someone or something. There are
several advantages to having boy soldiers. They are young and do
not questions authority and they follow directions without asking
questions. They are homeless and have no family and are desperate
to "belong" and have someone take care of them. Also, the boys are
angry that they have lost their homes and family and are fierce
fighters. Children want to please adults, they are people pleasers
and this is a great advantage for the military
leaders.<br></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style=

<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style=
"color: #000000;"><strong>How does the rehabilitation center help
Ishmael? What steps are taken to get him back on
track?</strong><br></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style=
"color: #000000;"><strong><br></strong>The rehab center's purpose
is to assimilate (fit in)&nbsp; Ishmael back into society. The
center gives Ishmael a roof over his head and 3 meals a day, so
that his basic needs are met. He is given medical care, counseling
and schooling. The center tries to reunite Ishmael with someone in
his family (his uncle), as well.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">"They know now that it is possible
for boys to be rehabilitated" (169).<br></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style=
"color: #000000;"><span style="color: #1c0ef0;"><span style=
"color: #000000;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">"I would always
tell people that I believe children have the resilience to outlive
their suffering, if given the chance"
(169).</span></span></span></span></span></p>

good soldier. He followed orders and was good at what he did. He
made the Army is family and was very loyal and dedicated to the
Lieutenant. Ishmael thought he was honoring his family, his real

soldier.</span></span> <span style="color: #1c0ef0;"><span style=

in the army as a "Junior Lieutenant". He tells the reader about a
raid on a village he was in charge of. They killed all of the
villagers, but captured enough food, drugs and ammunition for
several months.<br></span></span></p>

"color: #000000;"><span style="color: #1c0ef0;"><span style=
"color: #000000;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">"Alhaji acquired
the name "Little Rambo" and he did all he could in other raids to
live up to that name...My nickname was "Green Snake," because I
would situate myself in the most advantageous and sneaky position
and would take out a whole village from under the tiniest shrub
without being noticied"
(144).</span></span></span><br></span></span></p>
