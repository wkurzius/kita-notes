    <p><strong>“they carried like freight trains; they carried it on
            their backs and shoulders—and for all the ambiguities of Vietnam,
            all the mysteries and unknowns, there was at least the single
            abiding certainty that they would never be at a loss for things to
            carry” (O’Brien, 16).</strong></p>
    <p><strong>“They carried all the emotional baggage of men who might
            die. Grief, terror, love, longing”(O’Brien, 21).</strong></p>
    <p><strong>“they carried shameful memories.”(O’Brien,
            21).</strong></p>
    <p><strong>“they carried the common secret of cowardice.. the
            heaviest burden of all, for it could never be put down.” (O’Brien,
            21)</strong></p>

    <p><strong>"How to Tell a True War Story"-Pages 64-81</strong></p>
    <p>This chapter is NOT a war story. It is a LOVE story, about the
        special bond and love soldiers feel towards one another.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Tim O'Brien struggles to explain war stories. War is Hell, but
        also boredom, friendships, love and many other things.</p>
    <p>Never believe all war stories, especially if they are moral,
        because war is immoral.</p>
    <p>O'Brien writes that the some of the truest war stories never
        really happened.&nbsp;</p>

        soldiers pain, repeatedly shoots and wounds a baby water buffalo.
        He shoots to wound and torture, not to kill.</p>
    <p>Rat causes the baby water buffalo as much pain as he
        can.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>"The Dentist" Pages 82-84</strong></p>
    <p>During war, sometimes physical pain is easier to endure than
        emotional or mental pain.</p>
    <p>Another story about Curt Lemon who was a prankster, a comic and
        filled with bravado.</p>
    <p>A field dentist visits Alpha Comapany, Lemon is afraid of
        dentists and faints when it is his turn for an exam.</p>
    <p>Curt Lemon is so embarassed from fainiting due to fear he goes
        back to the dentist and insists the dentist pull out a perfectly
        good tooth to prove he is not a coward.</p>
    <p>Ironically, Curt Lemon is scared of a harmless visit to the
        dentist, but not afraid of playing with a grenade.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>"The Swetheart of the Song Tra Bong"-Pages
            85-110</strong></p>
    <p>A story told by Rat Kiley. Rat Kiley is known to exaggerate and
        lie when he tells a story.</p>
    <p>Rat is stationed at a First Aid Station in Chu Lai near the Song
        Tra Bong (a river). A relatively safe area.</p>
    <p>One day, Eddie Diamond, makes a joke that is so safe, that they
        could bring a girl to camp.</p>
    <p>Mark Fossie devises a way to bring his young and innocent
        girlfriend Mary Anne Bell to Vietnam.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Mary Anne is curious and a fast learner. She learns to speak
        Vietnamese, to cook Vietnamese food, to help in the hospital and to
        fire a gun.</p>
    <p>Mary Anne and mark Fossie are in love and get engaged.</p>
    <p>When Mark Fossie insisits it is time for Mary Anne to go back to
        the US, she disappears into the jungle with the Green Berets.</p>
    <p>As Mark Fossie goes crazy with worry, Mary Anne returns to camp.
        She wears a neclace of human tongues around her neck, She has
        become a stone cold killer.</p>
    <p>Rat Kiley gets transferred and does not know what happened to
        Mary Anne.</p>
    <p>Eddie Daimond says that Mary Anne crossed to the "other side"
        (evil) and has become part of the land of Vietnam.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Mary Anne is a symbol of the&nbsp;<strong>L</strong><strong>OSS
            OF INNOCENCE</strong> of all the young men who come to war as
        innocent young adults and become soldiers and killers.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>"Stockings"- Pages 111-112</strong></p>
    <p>Dobbins, the machine gunner, carried his girlfriend’s panty hose
        around his neck. They kept him safe and made him
        invincible.&nbsp;He was never hurt in Vietnam, not even a scratch.
        &nbsp;</p>
    <p>The irony that some soldiers will die and some soldiers will
        never even be injured in war.</p>
    <p><strong>"Church"-Pages 113-117</strong></p>
    <p>Alpha Company sets up camp near an abandoned pagoda (church)
        with monks.</p>
    <p>The monks seem to like the soldiers. They oil and clean Dobbins'
        machine gun.</p>
    <p>Dobbins thinks he might like to be a monk some day because he
        would look good in the robes and get to be nice to peole.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Kiowa, who is religious, is upset that the soldiers are using a
        religious site as a camp.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Ironically, American soldiers committed many violent and
        atrocious acts during the war like using a pagoda (church) as a
        camp and killing innocent people.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>"The Man I Killed"- Pages 118-124</strong></p>

    <p>Tim is paralyzed by his guilt.</p>
    <p>He imagines a fictional past and future life for the soldier.
        This solider will haunt Tim's dreams for the rest of his life.</p>
    <p>Kiowa, Tim's closest friend, explains to Tim it wasn't his
        fault. this is war. The young enenmy soldier would have done the
        same thing.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>"Ambush"-Pages 125-128</strong></p>
    <p>When Tim's daughter, Kathleen, asks him if he ever killed anyone
        in the war, Tim has another flashback to killing the yong
        soldier.</p>
    <p>Tim is filled with guilt. He has convinced himself that if he
        did not throw the grenade the yong soldier would have harmlessly
        walked by Tim.</p>
    <p>Twenty years after the war, Tim still sees the young enemy
        soldier at random times throughout his day and life.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>"Style"-Pages 129-130</strong></p>

    <p>Azar mocks the girls dance.</p>
    <p>Dobbins is so upset when Azar maked fun of the girl he threatens
        to dump Azar in a well.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Bowker considers unburdening himself at the local burger joint
        talking to a teenage stranger through a speaker.</p>
    <p>Norman drives around the lake 11 times.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Finally, Bowker walks into the lake, submerging himself in the
        water (a return to the shit field where Kiowa died?) (is Kiowa
        going to kill himself?)</p>
    <p>Norman emreges from the lake and watches the fieworks (mortar

    <p>&nbsp;This chapter is told to O'Brien by Mitchell Sanders. Tim
        has been injured and is at a field hospital.</p>
    <p>This chapter is about the mental anguish of war.</p>
    <p>Rat Kiley chooses the shame of being a coward and chooses to
        shoot himself in the foot rather than being killed or killing
        others.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In this chapter, Rat Kiley slowly goes crazy. He stops talking.
        He feels bugs crawling over his skin and cannot stop scratching.
        Rat says he is not cut out to be a medic always picking up the body
        parts and plugging the holes. He is haunted by Lavender and Lemon's
        deths. Rat Kiley has horrofic nightmares.</p>
    <p>Rat Kiley wakes up one morning and takes morphine and shoots
        himself in the toe, an injury that will get him sent home from the
        war. No one blames Rat.</p>
    <p>Lt. Cross promises to vouch for Rat Kiley and say the injury is
        a war wound.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>“Lavender was dead. You couldn’t burn the blame.” (Page 23)</p>
