<p>"Norman Bowker, otherwise a very gentle person, carried a thumb that had been presented to him as a gift from&nbsp;Mitchell Sanders."&nbsp;(O'Brien, 12).</p>
<p>&ldquo;he could not bring himself to be uncommonly brave.&rdquo; (page 141)</p>
<p>&ldquo;he would have talked about the medal he did not win and why he did not win it.&rdquo; (page 141)</p>
<p>&ldquo;I almost won the Silver Star.&rdquo; (page 141)</p>
<p>&ldquo;a story about a guy who feels like he got zapped over there in that shithole. A guy who can&rsquo;t get his act together and just drives around town all day and can&rsquo;t think of a damn place to go and doesn&rsquo;t know how to ge there anyway.&rdquo; (page 157)</p>
<p>&ldquo;That night when Kiowa got wasted, I sort of sank down into the sewage with him&hellip;Feels like I&rsquo;m still in deep shit. (page 156)</p>
<p>&ldquo;he had been braver than he had ever thought possible, but how he had not been so brave as he wanted to be.&rdquo; (page 152)</p>
<p>&ldquo;he&rsquo;d backed off and in that way had lost the Silver Star.&rdquo; (page 152)</p>

<p>&nbsp;Lt. Jimmy Cross is young and unprepared to be a leader. Incompetent. He feels responsible for the lives of his men and blames himself for Ted Lavender&rsquo;s and Kiowa&rsquo;s deaths during the war.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong><u>Quotes</u></strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Lavender was dead. You couldn&rsquo;t burn the blame.&rdquo; (Page 23)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;he&rsquo;d never forgiven himself for Lavender&rsquo;s death. It was something that would never go away.&rdquo; (Page 27)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;When a man died, there had to be blame. Jimmy Cross understood this.&rdquo; (Page 177)</p>
<p>&nbsp;"He felt shame. He hated himself. He had loved Martha more than his men, and as a consequence Lavender was now dead, and this was something he would have to carry like a stone in his stomach for the rest of the war.&rdquo; (Page 16)</p>

<p>Henry and the platoon spend a week camped out in a pagoda. Henry and Kiowa talk about religion. The Buddhist monks at the pagoda like Dobbins. Kiowa is religious, he thinks it is wrong to camp in the pagaoda. Dobbins is NOT religious, but he likes to be nice to people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong><u>Quotes</u></strong></p>
<p>"In many ways, he was like America itself, big and strong and full of good intentions, a roll of fat jiggling at his belly, slow of foot but always plodding along, always there when you neede him, a believer in the virtues of simplicity and directness and hard labor." (Page 117)</p>
<p>&nbsp;"It was his one eccentricity. The pantyhose, he said had the properties of a good luck charm.&rdquo;(Page 117)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;the stockings were a talisman for him. They kept him safe.&rdquo; (Page 118)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;He believed firmly and absolutely in the protective power of the stockings. They were like body armor.&rdquo; (Page 118)</p>
