<h6><span style="font-size: medium;">Glory Road</span></h6>
<p>By Dan Haskins and Dan Wetzel</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><span style="color: #ff0000;">CHAPTER 1- LEGEND</span></h1>
<p>Purpose of the chapter is to introduce the main character, Don
    Haskins to the reader and explain why Haskins is important.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Why Haskins wrote the book <em>Glory Road</em></h3>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Because he wants everyone to know the
    truth&mdash;that he wasn&rsquo;t a racial pioneer or a civil
    rights hero, he was just a simple coach seeking victory.&rdquo;(
    page 9)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just played my best players,&rdquo; he&rsquo;s told
    anyone who would listen for decades. (page 9)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is really, truly writing a book, honest to goodness, to
    make sure he gets less credit. (Page 9-10)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Wetzel describes Don Haskins</h3>
<p>&ldquo;the John Wayne of basketball, a hustler, a hard guy, a
    legend, who didn&rsquo;t want anyone, anywhere to know
    it.&rdquo; (Page 4)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was comfortable in El Paso&hellip;He wore a clip on tie
    for games. His truck had guns in it and, occasionally, coyote
    carcasses in the bed (They&rsquo;re payin&rsquo; seventy-five
    dollars for a skin, &ldquo; he&rsquo;d explain). (Page 4)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most of his friends were simple blue collar workers, often
    Mexican immigrants.&rdquo; (page 6)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He freely passes out extra money to honest people who have
    fallen a bit behind. He never tips less than thirty percent. He
    uses whatever connections he has with the wealthy to organize
    major relief efforts to poor villages on the other side of the
    Rio Grande, a humanitarian project he keeps a
    secret&rdquo;&nbsp; (Page 7)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don Haskins is the real McCoy, a once in a lifetime slice
    of Americana.&rdquo; (Page 7)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>THE 1966 NCAA CHAMPIONSHIP</h1>
<p>&ldquo;It was his decision to be the first college coach to start
    five black players that is his claim to fame.&rdquo; (Page 8)
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back then there was a simple coaching axiom. You can play
    two blacks at home, three on the road, and four if you were
    losing. But never, ever, five at once. That would get you
    fired.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Page 8)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pat Riley, a player on the opposing UK team would later
    call it, &ldquo;the Emancipation Proclamation of 1966.&rdquo;
    (Page 9)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He literally got thousands and thousands of black kids
    scholarships. And Haskins got death threats and hate mail.

    <li>His early life</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Childhood Experiences and Influences</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When it came to a depressed place in a depressed time,
    Enid Oklahoma, was a gold medal contender.&rdquo; (Page 15)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enid is a small town&hellip;surrounded by wheat fields&hellip;in
    the middle of the state&rsquo;s tornado alley and boy was it
    flat.&rdquo; (Page 15)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first paying job I ever had was at a feed store in
    downtown Enid&hellip;. I got paid a dollar a day.&rdquo; (Page
    17)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Herman Carr</h4>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></em></strong>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a coworker, Herman Carr. We were both fifteen. We
    both loved sports. We were both strong and athletic. We became
    fast friends, which normally wouldn&rsquo;t have been a big deal
    except for one thing&mdash;Herman Carr was black.&rdquo; (Page
    17)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some people were saying that I was the best player in all
    of Oklahoma and the reality was I wasn&rsquo;t even the best
    player in Enid. Herman Carr was.&rdquo; (Page 23)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one named him all state and no colleges came to recruit
    him because he was black.&rdquo; (Page 24)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Racism and Discrimination</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The blacks stayed on the other side of town. You rarely
    saw a black person at Sanford&rsquo;s Drug Store, the main
    burger and Coke place downtown. Black couldn&rsquo;t attend Enid
    High School; they went to Booker T. Washington
    High..&rdquo;&nbsp; (Page 18)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember being about thirteen and seeing a black soldier
    from Vance Air Force Base in full uniform have to use the
    colored fountain and thinking, He&rsquo;s good enough to get his
    ass shot for his country, but not to drink out of a fountain?
    That bothered me and stuck with me.&rdquo; (Page 18)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Great Shooter</h4>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></em></strong>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wound up becoming a great shooter because of my dad.
    Behind out house he had put up a hoop, but it wasn&rsquo;t a
    traditional-sized hoop. It was much smaller, like the kind they
    have at the carnival to try to con you into playing&hellip;.. I
    hated that rim&hellip;..By the time I got to high school the
    regulation-sized hoop was like a big tub. I could just throw it
    in there.&rdquo; (Page 19)</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Haskins went to Oklahoma A&amp;M on a basketball
            scholarship.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>He was coached by Mr. Henry Iba. </strong></li>
    <li><strong>Iba was a major influence on Haskins coaching
            style.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Coach-Mr. Henry Iba</h4>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></em></strong>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Playing for Mr. Iba was four years of hell.&rdquo; (Page
    31)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I realize that just about every good thing that ever
    happened to me in my life is a result of playing for Mr.
    Iba&hellip;the lessons he taught. The way he showed us how to
    conduct business, treat people, work hard and stay focused was
    invaluable.&rdquo; (Page 31-32)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I consider him the greatest man I ever met.&rdquo; (Page
    37)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Playing for Mr. Iba though; the four worst and four best
    years of my life.&rdquo; (Page 45)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Iba&rsquo;s influence</h4>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></em></strong>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;We practiced all year round. No summer vacation. On
    nonschool days, we&rsquo;d go three times a day, nine hours
    total.&rdquo; (Page 34)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Iba was big on fundamentals and defense.&rdquo; (Page
    34)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He valued each possession like it was his
    firstborn.&rdquo; (Page 34)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under Mr. Iba there was no sitting during
    practice&hellip;There was also no water.&rdquo; (Page 34)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is no different than how the military runs boot
    camp&hellip;.The players were best friends because all our hate
    was directed at Mr. Iba. And he liked it that way.&rdquo; (Page
    35)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nine hours of scrimmaging&hellip;.I got into the training
    room and took off my sock. The ball of my foot just fell off.
    The fat part came completely off. I got a bunch of tape from the
    trainer, taped it back on, and was ready to go the next day. I
    may have hated Mr. Iba, but I wasn&rsquo;t going to let him
    break me.&rdquo; (Page 37)</p>

<h1>Getting a college degree</h1>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></strong>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like a lot of college basketball players, after four years
    on campus, I hadn&rsquo;t earned a degree. Looking back on it, I
    was one stupid ole boy. I know that. How could upi be given such
    an opportunity &ndash;a free education&mdash;and not take full
    advantage of it? It&rsquo;s been over fifty years and I still
    haven&rsquo;t thought up a good reason. I&rsquo;ve spent a lot
    of time kicking myself for not getting&rsquo; it done, trust me.
    I think this why I used to harp on my players so much about
    earning that degree.&rdquo; (Page 48-49)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was twelve credits short of a degree.&rdquo; (Page 49)
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I started working on finishing my degree&hellip;It took
    three years&hellip; It seemed like every free moment I had was
    spent getting that degree.&rdquo; (Page 62)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>How he became a coach</h1>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></strong>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary suggested I get into coaching. She was probably smart
    enough to know I was too dumb to do anything else. She had been
    telling me since college that she wanted me to be a coach. The
    idea never appealed to me, but at this point in my life I
    didn&rsquo;t have any better ideas.&rdquo; (Page 50)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>First Job</h1>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></strong>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would pay $2,800 per year&hellip;I didn&rsquo;t have a
    degree and he didn&rsquo;t care. He said I couldn&rsquo;t teach
    without a degree, I could drive the school bus (an extra four
    hundred dollars) and coach.&rdquo; (Page 51)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t ever nervous about coaching. I was shy then
    (and still am), so about the only thing I ever feared was giving
    a speech to the Kiwanis Club or something.&rdquo; (Page 52)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I also had to coach six-man football.&rdquo; (Page 53)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My coaching career started with a loss.&rdquo; (Page 55)
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Coaching Girls</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I coached both boys&rsquo; and girls&rsquo; teams and I
    treated them equal, even though at the time no one else
    did.&rdquo; (Page 55)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you something interesting: In all my days
    of coaching girls I never had one quit. Not one. I had boys
    quit, but never girls.&rdquo; (Page 56)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeanie Sanders, fainted right on the court&hellip;.I was
    so mad about Jennie Sanders fainting, I started throwing thing
    around&hellip;I was upset and said, &ldquo;That damn Jeanie
    Sanders needs to get in shape.&rsquo; And I&rsquo;ll never
    forget the wife said, &lsquo;Don, she isn&rsquo;t out of shape,
    it was just that time of the month. Women get exhausted easily
    then.&rdquo; That time of the month? I had never even thought of
    it. It never entered my mind that girls have times of the month.
    I didn&rsquo;t even thank of them as girls, just players.&rdquo;
    (Page 61)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Pushing players</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A funny thing happened though&hellip;I guess I lightened
    up a little bit. I started going easy on the girls, you know,
    maybe one sprint when I used to give them ten&hellip;one day two
    of them came to me and complained that was favoring the boys
    more than the girls&hellip;then two mothers came and said they
    wanted me to treat the girls the same as the boys, that the
    girls deserved the same demands as the boys&hellip;a simple
    lesson, doesn&rsquo;t matter if it is a girl or a boy, a great
    player thrives on being pushed hard.&rdquo; (Page 61-62)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Setting the record for technical fouls</h1>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></strong>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once I even set what I believe to be the all-time record
    in the state of Texas (heck, maybe the world) for most technical
    fouls in a game. It was a girls&rsquo; game too. The game
    started and right off the bat the ref made this horrible call. I
    went nuts. Coaches didn&rsquo;t question many calls then in
    girls&rsquo; games because no one really cared about
    women&rsquo;s sports. But I did. I went out on the court
    screaming and hollering and this ref, he was a real character,
    he said, &ldquo;Haskins, you get a technical for every step it
    takes to get back to that bench.&rdquo; I figure he was joking
    but I turn around and start walking back and heard him say,
    &ldquo;Twelve, thirteen, fourteen.&rdquo; I wound up with
    sixteen technicals. They didn&rsquo;t throw you out of fames
    like they do now, which is why I figure I might have the
    record.&rdquo; (Pages 60-61)</p>

<h5><span style="color: #ff0000;">Chapter
        5-Shootin&rsquo;Pool</span></h5>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Don Haskins isn&rsquo;t perfect</strong></li>
    <li><strong>He has flaws</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Gambler and his gambling problem</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there was one thing, other than coaching, I was pretty
    good at in my life it was shooting pool. The problem is
    gambling, hustling, and playing nine ball and snooker is a
    sickness and it almost got me in a lot of trouble a number of
    times.&rdquo; (Page 67-68)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling you, a hustler is a terrible thing, I am
    serious when I say it is worse than bein&rsquo; a back robber.
    At least the bank robber is honest in what he is doing&mdash;he
    walks in and demands the money. A pool hustler doesn&rsquo;t
    have that kind of courage. But he is still stealing money. Pool
    hustling gets glamorized, but it is still about taking
    people&rsquo;s money. But I didn&rsquo;t realize that for
    years.&rdquo; (Page 70)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I was in college I was sick. I felt like anytime I
    needed a little money I could go hustle a little bit. The
    problem was, I always needed some money.&rdquo; (Page 70)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would make seventy or eighty dollars and leave.&rdquo;
    (Page 71)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Calling Coyotes</h1>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></strong>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you were a schoolteacher in Texas in those days you
    didn&rsquo;t shoot pool and you sure as hell didn&rsquo;t drink.
    What I did for fun was call coyotes and hunt them&hellip;I was a
    natural at it&hellip; I know that doesn&rsquo;t sound like much
    in the way of entertainment, but you had to do something in
    those towns.&rdquo; (Page 75)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Playing Golf</h1>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></strong>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I coached in Dumas, Texas&hellip;I took up a new
    pursuit, golf&hellip;I was out there screwing around with golf
    every day and I was starting to make progress. There was an ole
    boy who had a ranch and was a wheat farmer. He had a lot of
    money and was a prominent person around town&hellip;you
    don&rsquo;t beat a big time guy in town for money. So I kept
    saying no&hellip;I&rsquo;ve got the job at Texas-Western and I
    am going to be leaving town. Why not give the old rancher what
    he&rsquo;s been begging for? It&rsquo;s the least I could have
    done, right?&hellip;I just wiped him out. He was so rich he
    thought it was funny. He kept saying, &lsquo;Damn, coach, for
    months I couldn&rsquo;t get you to play for fifty cents and now
    you&rsquo;ll play for twelve hundred dollars?&rsquo; Yeah, well
    that how hustlers do it.&rdquo; (Page 77)</p>

<h1>Nolan Richardson</h1>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></strong>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first player I ever met at Texas Western was Nolan
    Richardson. He was a sophomore&hellip;I pulled up in a U-Haul
    truck full of family and furniture. He shook my hand and helped
    us move in&hellip;He would go on to be a successful college
    coach himself, winning the 1994 NCAA title at Arkansas.
    He&rsquo;s a legend in El Paso, the town even named a middle
    school after him.&rdquo; (Page 82)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Willie Brown</h1>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></strong>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willie Brown from New York, who would become a great
    player, a big success in business, and later instrumental in
    helping me to recruit the core of my 1966 national
    team&hellip;When I got the job I started receiving a letter from
    Willie every day asking me to give him a scholarship. Every day
    here came a letter&hellip;I figured that if a guy is writing me
    every day it must mean he couldn&rsquo;t play dead&hellip;My
    wife, Mary, however, liked him for his hunger. She was impressed
    with him&hellip;she encouraged me to sign Willie.&rdquo; (Page
    86)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>The First Bobby Joe Hill</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I call him the first because he was not the Bobby Joe Hill
    who would play on the 1966 championship team. Same name,
    different player.&rdquo; (Page 87)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only reason I got him was no one else would take
    him&hellip;Bob Rogers said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a black kid
    down her that I can&rsquo;t take.&rdquo;..He spent time in a
    reformatory in Huntsville, Texas. A reformatory? Why the hell
    would I want a guy out of a reformatory? (Page 88)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It turns out Bobby Joe and two of his friends broke into a
    Laundromat and, this part I will never forget, they stole
    $3.75&mdash;you can&rsquo;t be a little bit pregnant when it
    comes to stealing&mdash;but I&rsquo;m not sure a buck and a
    quarter haul each merited arresting all three of them&hellip;The
    sheriff to his credit, said that day, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to
    tell you the truth, if them boys weren&rsquo;t colored they
    wouldn&rsquo;t have been arrested.&rdquo; (Page 88)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Coaching Black Players</h1>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></strong>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I looked out on the floor I didn&rsquo;t see white
    guys and black guys, I saw players.&rdquo; (Page 90)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I treated my white guys and my black guys exactly the
    same. I don&rsquo;t think it was because I was some enlightened
    individual, it wasn&rsquo;t a conscious thing. I think it was
    that I was obsessed with basketball and I didn&rsquo;t want to
    go into that opener against Iowa State and get my ass
    beat.&rdquo; (Page 91)</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Haskins gives credit to Jim Barnes</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim &ldquo;Bad News&rdquo; Barnes. In the history of Texas
    Western/UTEP basketball there may never have been a more
    important player that Jim &ldquo;Bad News&rdquo; Barnes&rdquo;
    (Page 101)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;he set the stage for our success in the years to
    come.&rdquo; (Page 101)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim Barnes showed kids around the country that Texas
    Western was a place where great players played. Nothing attracts
    great recruits like great players.&rdquo; (Page 107)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Barnes was so good that my sports information director,
    Eddie Mullens, in a promotional effort, hung a nickname on him.
    He was Bad News Barnes because he was bad news for the
    opposition.&rdquo; (Page 107)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We finished 25-3 Barnes&rsquo; senior year (1963-64) and
    darn near won the national championship. In fact, to this day I
    still we should have won it. The three games we lost were the
    games that Barnes fouled out.&rdquo; (Page 109)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Free Throw Contest</h1>
<p>&ldquo;I bet Barnes that I could beat him in a free-throw
    shooting contest&hellip;We&rsquo;d each shoot twenty-five free
    throws. If he hit more than I did, I would go back to El Paso
    and never bother him again. If I hit more, then he would sign
    with Texas Western right then and there. I told him I
    wouldn&rsquo;t even take my sports coat off. He laughed and
    agreed to the terms of the bet&hellip;He went first and hit
    seventeen of twenty-five. I got up there and hit the first
    eighteen with no trouble at all, stopped and said,
    &ldquo;Sign.&rdquo; (Page 106)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Breaking NCAA Rules</h1>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></strong>
</p>
<p>&ldquo; I don&rsquo;t know if the NCAA had a rule against betting
    a commitment with a player on a shooting game, but I would have
    to think it violated some rule or another. So, I guess, I
    cheated to get Jim Barnes, but it was worth it.&rdquo; (Page

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no official record of what game (or even what
    season) the historic event occurred.&rdquo; (Page 114)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t remember the exact moment I decided to start
    five black players.&rdquo; (Page 116)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyone who played for me can tell you I treated everyone
    the same, that race was not a factor in how I coached the
    team.&rdquo; (Page 117)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All I had done is exactly what a coach is supposed to do;
    I started my five best players in an effort to maximize the
    chances of winning the game. To me they were just kids in white
    and orange uniforms. Not white guys, not black guys, just
    Miners. In later years I coached Hispanics, Native Americans,
    and foreign players. To me, they were all the same. They were my
    players. I certainly wasn&rsquo;t trying to make a social
    statement. I just wanted to win. If my five best players were
    from Mars, I would have started five Martians.&rdquo; (Page 120)
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girls&rsquo; basketball wasn&rsquo;t much back then, but I
    didn&rsquo;t see the difference. A team was a team. Players were
    players, white, black, male or female. I was in charge of the
    ream and our goal was to win games. Why would I care about
    anything else?&rdquo; (Page 120)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Years later people would refer to our national
    championship game against the University of Kentucky as the
    Brown v. Board of Education of college athletics, the linchpin
    that broke the color barrier for good. I always laughed at that.
    It was only big because we won. What if we had lost?&rdquo;
    (Page 120)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the time, the last thing I expected was it would become
    a big deal. At the time I just wanted to win that game.
    Although, honestly, I don&rsquo;t even remember which game it
    was.&rdquo; (Page 121)</p>

            the championship team</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Introduces players on the championship team</strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Hilton White</h1>
<p>&ldquo;One of the keys to recruiting our championship team was a
    man named Hilton White. He coached in the playground leagues in
    New York City. And was just a class guy&hellip;The kids all
    loved Hilton and if he said, &ldquo;This is where you are going
    to school.&rdquo; Well, that was where they were going to
    school&hellip;Hilton was always in my corner&hellip;He would
    tell them they needed to stay put, listen, and work
    harder&hellip;He wanted what was best for his players, and what
    was best was getting that education.&rdquo; (Page 131-132)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>The Second Bobby Joe Hill</h1>
<p>&ldquo;The second Bobby Joe Hill was the quickest guard I&rsquo;d
    ever seen.&rdquo; (Page 125)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Over Coaching</h1>
<p>&ldquo;I made him dribble the ball in front of him&hellip;he
    tried&hellip;but he kicked the ball away about half the
    time&hellip;He got frustrated, but he accepted it. He never
    bitched, never complained&hellip;It was my fault he was
    struggling because I was overcoaching him.&rdquo; (Page 125)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>David Lattin</h1>
<p>&ldquo;He was the next &ldquo;Bad News Barnes&rdquo; (Page 126)
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;David went to Tennessee State, but after a semester he was
    miserable&hellip;&rdquo;Coach send me a ticket and I&rsquo;ll
    come to Texas Western. I want to come and play for you . Just
    send me the ticket.&rdquo;&hellip;One plane ticket and I get
    David Lattin? That didn&rsquo;t seem like a big deal. But it was
    illegal&hellip;I can&rsquo;t do it David. You&rsquo;ll have to
    find a way here yourself.&rsquo;&hellip;I am here. I came by
    bus. He had taken a bus straight through, for twenty-four
    hours&hellip;.It turns out (as I would find out many years
    later) that just picking David up in downtown El Paso and
    driving him a few miles to campus was violating one of the
    NCAA&rsquo;s more questionable rules.&rdquo; (Page 128)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;he was a big, tough guy with a cool Fu Manchu. His
    nickname was Big Daddy D&hellip;and had a teal popular radio
    show called &ldquo;The Big D Jazz Session&hellip;I once asked
    him if he had any bad habits at all and he smiled and said.
    &ldquo;Chasing babes.&rdquo; (Page 129)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Don&rsquo;t Box yourself in</h1>
<p>&ldquo;The next player who shows up late is kicked off the team.
    Gone. Cut. No appeals. Well, the guy who shows up late is Jimmy
    Holmes, who was from El Paso and had never been on my bad
    side&hellip;.He even had a good excuse for being late, he was in
    class. I had boxed myself in and I kicked him off the team
    anyway&hellip;That was over forty years ago and to this day I
    feel bad about that. It was bad judgment.&rdquo; (Page 131)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Willie Cager</h1>
<p>&ldquo;First off, not only did Willie Cager not play high school
    basketball, he hadn&rsquo;t gone to high school. He had worked
    and gotten his diploma by going to night school&hellip;He was
    helping his family.&rdquo; (Page 133)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I offered Cager a scholarship and never regretted
    it&hellip;Cager had to take two college level English classes.
    He had no money, so he came to El Paso and found a job working
    while going to class. He didn&rsquo;t have money for rent
    either&hellip;Willie got a cot set up in one of the grease
    pits&hellip;when the shop was closed he slept in there.&rdquo;
    (Page 134)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Nevil Shed&rsquo;s Mother</h1>
<p>&ldquo;She was a great woman&mdash;tough as nails. She wanted
    Nevil to get a diploma and to call her if he gave me any
    problems and it would be taken care of. Nevil was rightfully
    afraid of his mother&hellip;She saw the incredible opportunities
    basketball could give her son&mdash;sadly, it was rare that a
    black kid got to attend college.&rdquo; (Page 134-135)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>TWC</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Texas Westen College wasn&rsquo;t exactly considered the
    coolest thing in the neighborhood.&rdquo; (Page 135)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Texas Women&rsquo;s College&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Teeny Weenie College&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h1>Value of a Basketball Scholarship</h1>
<p>&ldquo;The players who go on to the NBA ate the ones who make
    millions and get the media attention, but it&rsquo;s the
    education so many of us (myself included) get while playing
    college sports that&rsquo;s invaluable.&rdquo; (Page 136)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Black Leaders</h1>
<p>&ldquo;I get a lot attention for being the first to start five
    black players in a game, but if it weren&rsquo;t for all of the
    leaders in the black community who helped send these kids to me
    it never would have happened. There are countless heroes in this
    tale and I thank all of them, even if they sent their players to
    someone else.&rdquo; (Page 136)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Helping communities</h1>
<p>&ldquo;This wasn&rsquo;t about just winning basket ball games.
    This was about helping these young men, helping entire
    communities.&rdquo; (Page 136)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Harry Flournoy</h1>
<p>Pie Incident</p>
<p>&ldquo; Harry Flournoy was walking home from school for
    lunch&hellip;I asked if he wanted a ride. He said he
    didn&rsquo;t&hellip;.We drove to his house and waited for
    him&hellip;I met his mother, Amy, a great woman&hellip;she
    offered me the last piece of pie in the house&hellip;he sat down
    for lunch&hellip;asked his mother for dessert. Amy said,
    &ldquo;Harry, there is none left. I gave the last piece to our
    guest, Coach Haskins&hellip;He was so made at me that he
    wouldn&rsquo;t let me drive him back to school&hellip;After the
    pie incident I thought we would never sign him.&rdquo; (Page
    138)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mother comes to TWC</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amy Flournoy trusted me and told her boy he was going to
    El Paso&hellip;I loved that woman&hellip;Harry&rsquo;s freshman
    year I caught him ditching class and saw his grades were
    slipping, so I called her&hellip;He walked in, saw his mother,
    and then we both read him the riot act. He was scared straight.
    I don&rsquo;t think Harry ever skipped class again. (Page

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;West Texas has been good to Haskins except, it seems, when
    it came to business&hellip;he drilled for oil and found nothing
    but dirt&hellip;His friends all call him the smartest man they
    ever met, someone in possession an uncommon amount of common
    sense&hellip;Haskins sunk $22, 500 into a lettuce field, a good
    chunk of savings&hellip; lost it all&hellip;As a businessman, he
    made a hell of a basketball coach.&rdquo; (Pages 141-142)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Fighting the Team</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I spent half the season worrying about Bobby Joe Hill,
    fighting with David Lattin to practice hard, and trying to get
    everyone to play together. This was easily the most talent4ed
    team I had ever coached, but they were a pain in the ass when it
    came to practice.&rdquo; (Page 143)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had to fight this team so hard every single day. WE had
    five players&hellip;who were left-handed. So, maybe that
    explained it.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Page 151)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>David Lattin</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was always trying to get Lattin jacked up&hellip;Lattin
    wouldn&rsquo;t play hard because the center was white. He
    didn&rsquo;t think a white guy could play.&rdquo; (Page 143)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gave the maintenance man a dollar and told him to tape
    it up well above the square on the backboard&hellip;maybe
    fourteen feet up&hellip;in walked David Lattin, he was always
    dressed teal nice, always well groomed. He had on them
    Italian-looking shoes&hellip;Lattin just smiled, walked over,
    and just hopped up there and picked it off the backboard. No
    warmup, in dress clothes and Italian shoes&hellip;Moe starts
    right in with me, &ldquo;Lattin plays harder for money than he
    does for you.&rdquo; (Page 144)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Togo Railey</h1>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></strong>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Togo was the fan favorite, a local guy who played only
    when we were up big. Late in the game the crowd would chant,
    &ldquo;To-go, To-go,&rdquo; so I would put him in. He was my
    human victory cigar.&rdquo; (Page 145)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>No one wants to play TWC</h1>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></strong>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were still Tiny Weenie College from El Paso. If your
    are a major school&hellip;why would play us?&hellip;a no-win
    situation. If you win the game, everyone says, &lsquo;Well, you
    are supposed to beat them, that&rsquo;s TWC.&rsquo; But if you
    lose, and with the team I had the odds were pretty good you
    weren&rsquo;t going to just lose you were going to get your ass
    kicked, the critics would be all over you&hellip;it was better
    just to avoid us completely.&rdquo; (Page 145)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>El Paso</h1>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></strong>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;El Paso had no other sports teams then and really no
    national identity al all&hellip;the people of El Paso embraced
    something of their own and became Texas Western Miner fans. It
    was great&hellip;The fans were unbelievable&hellip;their
    enthusiasm and support was out of control&hellip;.when we landed
    at the airport there would be two or three thousand people
    waiting for us.&rdquo; (Page 150)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our city doesn&rsquo;t get much national attention and
    back then it was even smaller. Which is why the whole city was
    behind us, a feeling I can&rsquo;t describe, but am humbled
    about to this day.&rdquo; (Page 169)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Breaking Curfew</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was so angry with my team so I set a curfew that
    night&hellip;I didn&rsquo;t want any crap that night. Well,
    Bobby Joe apparently knew some girls in Seattle and he and the
    rest of the team snuck out. Probably the only funny thing about
    the whole incident was finding Shed in his room&hellip;I went
    crashing into his room and he was under the covers, looking at
    me with a smile, pretending like he was just trying to get some
    sleep&hellip;He had the covers pulled up to his chin&hellip;I
    yanked the blankets off of him and there he is, fully dressed,
    shoes and all. I had caught him before he left&hellip;.Angry
    doesn&rsquo;t describe me at that point&hellip;guys got back
    around 3:00 am&hellip;we woke them up at 4:30 am claiming we had
    an early flight&hellip;on the plane if anyone even looked like
    he was about to doze off to go back and wake him up&hellip;I was
    too angry to sleep, then by God I wanted them too angry to
    sleep.&rdquo; (Pages 154-155)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo; I don&rsquo;t think Haskins owns a real tie. He hates
    dressing up at all, preferring an open collar with some room to
    breathe&hellip;Haskins wore the tie for less than a minute each
    game, just long enout to take the court with an air of business
    sensibility. &lsquo;Mr. Iba told me before my first game as a
    high school coach always to wear a tie&hellip;I noted to him the
    entire building was named after him and, in reality, the clip-on
    act wasn&rsquo;t fooling anyone&hellip;&rsquo;Mr. Iba said to
    wear a tie,&rsquo; he said, ending the discussion and
    straightening the tie.&rdquo; (Page 159)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Bobby Joe Hill becomes a Leader</h3>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;I was so mad at Bobby Joe Hill for the Seattle debacle, I
    benched him..I noticed Bobby Joe wasn&rsquo;t sitting back on
    the bench pouting, like a lot of guys would. WE huddled up, and
    even though he wasn&rsquo;t playing, Hill was right in the
    middle, grabbing guys by the shirt, getting in their faces,
    shouting encouragements, even giving some advice on what he had
    seen. I loved it, He was, after all, the leader of the
    team&hellip;seven minutes before halftime when I put him in. The
    benching was over. He was such a smart player. Instead of
    pouting he had studied the game. So once he got in the game,
    problems solved, we won easily.&rdquo; (Pages 163-164)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Team doctor-Technical Foul</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;my team doctor, Joe Galatzan, was sitting down at the end
    of the bench hollering at an official something fierce for
    making a bad call. All of the sudden the official gave my team
    doctor a technical. I couldn&rsquo;t believe it. My team
    doctor&hellip;I felt sorry for him&hellip;Dr. Joe said,
    &lsquo;Coach, I&rsquo;m sorry.&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;You
    didn&rsquo;t do a damn thing. I was fixin&rsquo; to get one
    myself.&rsquo;&rdquo; (Page 163)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Nevil Shed&rsquo;s mother</h3>
<p>&ldquo;a big old white boy, knocked the crap out of Jerry
    Armstrong when Armstrong wasn&rsquo;t looking, but Nevil Shed
    saw him. The next time down the court Shed laid Rolfe out with a
    punch&hellip;Shed got booted from the game&hellip;I
    wouldn&rsquo;t let him sit on the bench. I sent him to the
    dressing room and told him he was off the team, sholarship
    revoked and everything. I was that angry&hellip;She came up to
    me crying. He was apologizing and begging and carrying on. He
    had called his mother&hellip;told her he was coming home and had
    been kicked off the team&hellip;his mother wanted to speack to
    me&hellip;Most parents will automatically defend their
    children&hellip;she says, &lsquo;Coach, make that boy walk home.
    Make him walk back to New York City. Don&rsquo;t you even give
    him a ride to the bus station.&rsquo;&hellip;She was angrier at
    Shed than I was. So I decided then and there to keep him on the
    team. I figured I was saving him from the whipping of his life.
    I did bench him for the start of the next game though.&rdquo;
    (Pages 166-167)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Racism on the team</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;On our team, as far as I knew then or have ever heard,
    there were no racial problems, no divisions. Jerry Armstrong was
    white and when he got hit with a cheap shot, Nevil Shed, who was
    black, didn&rsquo;t hesitate to stick up for him. It
    wasn&rsquo;t about race with us.&rdquo; (Page 16</p>

<h3>Charitable and Humble</h3>
<p>&ldquo;A young Mexican family were driving from Van Horn to Los
    Angeles&hellip;their car broke down&hellip;out in the
    desert&hellip;Coach was out hunting and he stopped to help.
    &hellip;this family had no money, so he got a two truck to bring
    the station wagon to El Paso and loaded the whole family into
    his truck. He then paid for the tow, paid to get the car fixed,
    and since it took two days for the work to be done, put the
    family up in a motel and gave them cash for food&hellip;he
    didn&rsquo;t tell a soul about it. Not one person. He
    didn&rsquo;t want anyone to know. He didn&rsquo;t want any
    credit.&rdquo; (Pages 171-172)</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h3>Jerry Armstrong stops Chambers/Utah</h3>
<p>&ldquo;my black guys would never have gotten the chance to start
    in that game if it wasn&rsquo;t for one of their white
    teammates, Jerry Armstrong&hellip;none of my big guys could stop
    Utah&rsquo;s Jerry Chambers&hellip;Lattin and Harry Flournoy
    were out. Chambers was just unbelievable&hellip;Armstrong had a
    sprained ankle. Well, he did better than anyone else had and
    slowed Chambers down at the end of the game. We won 85-78, but
    only because of Armstrong. Maybe, Jerry Armstrong is the white
    guy who should get the credit for integrating college
    basketball. It sure as hell wasn&rsquo;t me guarding Jerry
    Chambers.&rdquo; (Page 177)</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h3>The team</h3>
<p>&ldquo;My guys were taking naps, daydreaming, looking for girls
    in the stands. This was the loosest team I ever had.&rdquo;
    (Page 181)</p>
<h3>Lattin dunks the ball to intimidate Kentucky</h3>
<p>&ldquo;I told Lattin&hellip;I want yuou to take it to the rim and
    dunk it on someone. Just knock them over. Just dunk it like they
    ain&rsquo;t never seen it dunked. Not in person, not on
    television. I don&rsquo;t care if you get called for a charge,
    for traveling, rip off the backboard, anything. Just dunk the
    damn thing. Take it at their center and run his ass
    over&hellip;To see the 240 pound David Lattin charging down the
    land was one scary sight. Only one guy tried to defend the play,
    Pat Riley. I respected him for that&hellip;David dunked it on
    his head, just slammed it right down on his head. No foul. No
    travel. Just two points for the Miners.&rdquo; (Page 183-184)
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Not a memorable game</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Oddly enough the most memorable thing about the actual
    game was the lack of memorable moments.&rdquo; (Page 184)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the end they never really threatened u s. We led by 11
    with 3:22 remaining. It didn&rsquo;t end up a blowout, but we
    won fairly easily, 72-65.&rdquo; (Page 186)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Bobby Joe Hill steals the show</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Bobby Joe stole it from him (Louis Dampier) and drove it
    for a layup. Dampier regrouped and started bringing the ball up
    again, this time more cautiously. But Bobby Joe was just so
    quick that right at center court he did it again, picking
    Dampier;s pocket and going in for another layup, 14 to 9 us with
    9:56 to go&hellip;Everyone in Cole Fieldhouse must have thought
    that anytime Bobby Joe wanted to steal that ball from Louis
    Dampier he could. Bobby Joe certainly thought that.&rdquo; (Page
    185)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The Media-Ed Sullivan Show</h3>
<p>&ldquo;I know my three New York players (Shed, Worsley, and
    Cager) were excited because back then the NCAA championship team
    usually got invited to appear on <em>The Ed Sullivan Show,
    </em>which was filmed in Manhattans. So they were more excited
    about a free trip back home to New York than winning the
    championship. Of course, in a sign of things to come, Ed
    Sullivan didn&rsquo;t invite Texas Western on his show.&rdquo;
    (Pages 187-188)</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Haskins Loves El Paso</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;In six short seasons I had grown to love the city and the
    school, so it meant a lot to me to give the people something to
    be proud of. And it was one of the reasons why, when some
    bigger, richer schools came a-calling after I had led little
    Texas Western to the national title, I never left. El Paso was
    my home now.&rdquo; (Page 188)</p>

<h3>Giving the NCAA hell</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Haskins arrived looking sharp by his standards&mdash;which
    meant his plaid button down shirt had no barbeque
    stains&hellip;sitting in the front row&hellip;this was the media
    and NCAA power base that had made life miserable for him, his
    players and his program&hellip;the old cowboy had neither
    forgotten nor forgiven&hellip;getting some shots in&hellip;noted
    his decision was unpopular at the time. He named some names in
    the media. He went on to criticize the NCAA&hellip;he got after
    them for the confusing and corrupt way it enforces its myriad
    rules since, he noted it is generally the big schools that are
    cheating their asses off, but the small ones that get
    punished.&rdquo; (Pages 191-192)</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h3>Positive Effects</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Chuck Foreman, the great NFL running back, &hellip;stopped
    me and he said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve always wanted to thank you for
    giving black guys like myself a chance to go to school.&rsquo;
    He just said all the right things, and it made me feel real
    good.&rdquo; (Page 193)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nolan Richardson would declare I was responsible for
    &ldquo;thousands of scholarships for blacks in the South.&rdquo;
    (Page 193)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The positive impact of the fame through the increased
    opportunity for black players. Before we beat Kentucky there was
    not a single black basketball or football player in the
    Southeastern, Southwest, or Atlantic Conference. Not one. A
    couple months after we won, Vanderbilt of the SEC recruited the
    first black basketball player and the floodgates opened.&rdquo;
    (Page 194)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hate Mail</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought winning the national championship was the worst
    thing ever to happen to me. I wished for a long time that we had
    never won that game with Kentucky because life would have been a
    heck of a lot easier for me, my school and my players.&rdquo;
    (Page 192)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Within a week of winning the national championship the
    hate mail flowed in by the garbage bucket&hellip;There were bags
    and bags of nasty, racist, ignorant letters. Most of them came
    for the South and a lot of them form Kentucky.&rdquo; (Page 193)
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>New Version of Hate Mail</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Black ministers calling me an exploiter. All of the sudden
    I was the racist. Supposedly, I was just using black kids to win
    games and I didn&rsquo;t care at all about them&hellip;Nolan
    Richardson said, &ldquo;Coach, we&rsquo;ve got them on both
    sides.&rdquo; (Page 198)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Biased Media</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Adolph Rupp (coach of Kentucky) said some thing to anger
    me&hellip;He told the <em>Courier-Journal </em>of Louisville
    that I had recruited David Lattin out of Tennessee State Prison,
    when in fact David had been a student at Tennessee State
    University.&rdquo; (Page 195)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Sports Illustrated </em>&nbsp;came to town&hellip;said
    I exploited black players, that our kids weren&rsquo;t real
    students and El Paso was a community that was unfriendly to
    minorities&hellip;that El Paso was so racist that none of my
    players&rsquo; wives could get jobs there. Wives? None of my
    players were even married.&rdquo; (Page 196)</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h3>Haskins Biggest Regret</h3>
<p><strong>&ldquo;</strong>File a lawsuit again <em>Sports
        Illustrated&hellip;</em>I deeply, deeply regret that I
    didn&rsquo;t file one myself&hellip;This was a mistake and
    perhaps the biggest regret of my life. I have never forgiven the
    magazine. Not to this very day. That magazine hurt my players
    and their parents. And it was wrong.&rdquo; (Page 196-197)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;1976 James Michener released a book called <em>Sports in
        America</em>&hellip;Michener referred to our championship
    team as &lsquo;one of the most wretched episodes in the history
    of American sport.&rsquo; Can you believe that? We were just
    college kids playing basketball. How can that be wretched? He
    claimed my players were criminals and nonstudents&hellip;suing
    Michener&mdash;not for the money though. I just wanted to get
    him into an El Paso courtroom so I might get close enough to get
    my hands around his neck, haul his ass outside, and drag him
    through the weeds for a while. A good ass-kicking might have
    been satisfaction enough for me&hellip;I deeply, deeply regret
    this to this day I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; (Page 197)</p>
