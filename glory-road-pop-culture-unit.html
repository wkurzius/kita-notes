<h1>Glory Road" Pop Culture Unit</h1>
<h6><span style="font-size: medium;">Glory Road</span></h6>
<p>By Dan Haskins and Dan Wetzel</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><span style="color: #ff0000;">CHAPTER 1- LEGEND</span></h1>
<p>Purpose of the chapter is to introduce the main character, Don
Haskins to the reader and explain why Haskins is important.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Why Haskins wrote the book <em>Glory Road</em></h3>
<p>&nbsp;“Because he wants everyone to know the truth—that he
wasn’t a racial pioneer or a civil rights hero, he was just a
simple coach seeking victory.”( page 9)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I just played my best players,” he’s told anyone who would
listen for decades. (page 9)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“He is really, truly writing a book, honest to goodness, to make
sure he gets less credit. (Page 9-10)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Wetzel describes Don Haskins</h3>
<p>“the John Wayne of basketball, a hustler, a hard guy, a legend,
who didn’t want anyone, anywhere to know it.” (Page 4)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“He was comfortable in El Paso…He wore a clip on tie for games.
His truck had guns in it and, occasionally, coyote carcasses in the
bed (They’re payin’ seventy-five dollars for a skin, “ he’d
explain). (Page 4)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Most of his friends were simple blue collar workers, often
Mexican immigrants.” (page 6)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“He freely passes out extra money to honest people who have
fallen a bit behind. He never tips less than thirty percent. He
uses whatever connections he has with the wealthy to organize major
relief efforts to poor villages on the other side of the Rio
Grande, a humanitarian project he keeps a secret”&nbsp; (Page
7)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Don Haskins is the real McCoy, a once in a lifetime slice of
Americana.” (Page 7)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>THE 1966 NCAA CHAMPIONSHIP</h1>
<p>“It was his decision to be the first college coach to start five
black players that is his claim to fame.” (Page 8)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Back then there was a simple coaching axiom. You can play two
blacks at home, three on the road, and four if you were losing. But
never, ever, five at once. That would get you fired.”&nbsp; (Page
8)</p>
<p>“Pat Riley, a player on the opposing UK team would later call
it, “the Emancipation Proclamation of 1966.” (Page 9)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He literally got thousands and thousands of black kids
scholarships. And Haskins got death threats and hate mail. “(Page
9)</p>

Enid, Oklahoma in 1930</h3>

<li><strong>Childhood Experiences and Influences</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“When it came to a depressed place in a depressed time, Enid
Oklahoma, was a gold medal contender.” (Page 15)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enid is a small town…surrounded by wheat fields…in the middle of
the state’s tornado alley and boy was it flat.” (Page 15)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The first paying job I ever had was at a feed store in downtown
Enid…. I got paid a dollar a day.” (Page 17)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Herman Carr</h4>
<p><strong><em><span style=
"text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></em></strong></p>
<p>“I had a coworker, Herman Carr. We were both fifteen. We both
loved sports. We were both strong and athletic. We became fast
friends, which normally wouldn’t have been a big deal except for
one thing—Herman Carr was black.” (Page 17)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Some people were saying that I was the best player in all of
Oklahoma and the reality was I wasn’t even the best player in Enid.
Herman Carr was.” (Page 23)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“No one named him all state and no colleges came to recruit him
because he was black.” (Page 24)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Racism and Discrimination</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The blacks stayed on the other side of town. You rarely saw a
black person at Sanford’s Drug Store, the main burger and Coke
place downtown. Black couldn’t attend Enid High School; they went
to Booker T. Washington High..”&nbsp; (Page 18)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I remember being about thirteen and seeing a black soldier from
Vance Air Force Base in full uniform have to use the colored
fountain and thinking, He’s good enough to get his ass shot for his
country, but not to drink out of a fountain? That bothered me and
stuck with me.” (Page 18)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Great Shooter</h4>
<p><strong><em><span style=
"text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></em></strong></p>
<p>“I wound up becoming a great shooter because of my dad. Behind
out house he had put up a hoop, but it wasn’t a traditional-sized
hoop. It was much smaller, like the kind they have at the carnival
to try to con you into playing….. I hated that rim…..By the time I
got to high school the regulation-sized hoop was like a big tub. I
could just throw it in there.” (Page 19)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span style=

<ul>
<li><strong>Haskins went to Oklahoma A&amp;M on a basketball
scholarship.</strong></li>
<li><strong>He was coached by Mr. Henry Iba.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Iba was a major influence on Haskins coaching
style.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Coach-Mr. Henry Iba</h4>
<p><strong><em><span style=
"text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></em></strong></p>
<p>“Playing for Mr. Iba was four years of hell.” (Page 31)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I realize that just about every good thing that ever happened
to me in my life is a result of playing for Mr. Iba…the lessons he
taught. The way he showed us how to conduct business, treat people,
work hard and stay focused was invaluable.” (Page 31-32)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I consider him the greatest man I ever met.” (Page 37)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Playing for Mr. Iba though; the four worst and four best years
of my life.” (Page 45)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Iba’s influence</h4>
<p><strong><em><span style=
"text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></em></strong></p>
<p>“We practiced all year round. No summer vacation. On nonschool
days, we’d go three times a day, nine hours total.” (Page 34)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Mr. Iba was big on fundamentals and defense.” (Page 34)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“He valued each possession like it was his firstborn.” (Page
34)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Under Mr. Iba there was no sitting during practice…There was
also no water.” (Page 34)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It is no different than how the military runs boot camp….The
players were best friends because all our hate was directed at Mr.
Iba. And he liked it that way.” (Page 35)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Nine hours of scrimmaging….I got into the training room and
took off my sock. The ball of my foot just fell off. The fat part
came completely off. I got a bunch of tape from the trainer, taped
it back on, and was ready to go the next day. I may have hated Mr.
Iba, but I wasn’t going to let him break me.” (Page 37)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Getting a college degree</h1>
<p><strong><span style=
"text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>“Like a lot of college basketball players, after four years on
campus, I hadn’t earned a degree. Looking back on it, I was one
stupid ole boy. I know that. How could upi be given such an
opportunity –a free education—and not take full advantage of it?
It’s been over fifty years and I still haven’t thought up a good
reason. I’ve spent a lot of time kicking myself for not getting’ it
done, trust me. I think this why I used to harp on my players so
much about earning that degree.” (Page 48-49)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I was twelve credits short of a degree.” (Page 49)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I started working on finishing my degree…It took three years…
It seemed like every free moment I had was spent getting that
degree.” (Page 62)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>How he became a coach</h1>
<p><strong><span style=
"text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>“Mary suggested I get into coaching. She was probably smart
enough to know I was too dumb to do anything else. She had been
telling me since college that she wanted me to be a coach. The idea
never appealed to me, but at this point in my life I didn’t have
any better ideas.” (Page 50)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>First Job</h1>
<p><strong><span style=
"text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>“It would pay $2,800 per year…I didn’t have a degree and he
didn’t care. He said I couldn’t teach without a degree, I could
drive the school bus (an extra four hundred dollars) and coach.”
(Page 51)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I wasn’t ever nervous about coaching. I was shy then (and still
am), so about the only thing I ever feared was giving a speech to
the Kiwanis Club or something.” (Page 52)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I also had to coach six-man football.” (Page 53)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“My coaching career started with a loss.” (Page 55)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Coaching Girls</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I coached both boys’ and girls’ teams and I treated them equal,
even though at the time no one else did.” (Page 55)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you something interesting: In all my days of coaching
girls I never had one quit. Not one. I had boys quit, but never
girls.” (Page 56)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Jeanie Sanders, fainted right on the court….I was so mad about
Jennie Sanders fainting, I started throwing thing around…I was
upset and said, “That damn Jeanie Sanders needs to get in shape.’
And I’ll never forget the wife said, ‘Don, she isn’t out of shape,
it was just that time of the month. Women get exhausted easily
then.” That time of the month? I had never even thought of it. It
never entered my mind that girls have times of the month. I didn’t
even thank of them as girls, just players.” (Page 61)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Pushing players</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“A funny thing happened though…I guess I lightened up a little
bit. I started going easy on the girls, you know, maybe one sprint
when I used to give them ten…one day two of them came to me and
complained that was favoring the boys more than the girls…then two
mothers came and said they wanted me to treat the girls the same as
the boys, that the girls deserved the same demands as the boys…a
simple lesson, doesn’t matter if it is a girl or a boy, a great
player thrives on being pushed hard.” (Page 61-62)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Setting the record for technical fouls</h1>
<p><strong><span style=
"text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>“Once I even set what I believe to be the all-time record in the
state of Texas (heck, maybe the world) for most technical fouls in
a game. It was a girls’ game too. The game started and right off
the bat the ref made this horrible call. I went nuts. Coaches
didn’t question many calls then in girls’ games because no one
really cared about women’s sports. But I did. I went out on the
court screaming and hollering and this ref, he was a real
character, he said, “Haskins, you get a technical for every step it
takes to get back to that bench.” I figure he was joking but I turn
around and start walking back and heard him say, “Twelve, thirteen,
fourteen.” I wound up with sixteen technicals. They didn’t throw
you out of fames like they do now, which is why I figure I might
have the record.” (Pages 60-61)</p>

5-Shootin’Pool</span></h5>
<p><strong><span style=

<ul>
<li><strong>Don Haskins isn’t perfect</strong></li>
<li><strong>He has flaws</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gambler and his gambling problem</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“If there was one thing, other than coaching, I was pretty good
at in my life it was shooting pool. The problem is gambling,
hustling, and playing nine ball and snooker is a sickness and it
almost got me in a lot of trouble a number of times.” (Page
67-68)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I’m telling you, a hustler is a terrible thing, I am serious
when I say it is worse than bein’ a back robber. At least the bank
robber is honest in what he is doing—he walks in and demands the
money. A pool hustler doesn’t have that kind of courage. But he is
still stealing money. Pool hustling gets glamorized, but it is
still about taking people’s money. But I didn’t realize that for
years.” (Page 70)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“When I was in college I was sick. I felt like anytime I needed
a little money I could go hustle a little bit. The problem was, I
always needed some money.” (Page 70)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I would make seventy or eighty dollars and leave.” (Page
71)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Calling Coyotes</h1>
<p><strong><span style=
"text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>“If you were a schoolteacher in Texas in those days you didn’t
shoot pool and you sure as hell didn’t drink. What I did for fun
was call coyotes and hunt them…I was a natural at it… I know that
doesn’t sound like much in the way of entertainment, but you had to
do something in those towns.” (Page 75)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Playing Golf</h1>
<p><strong><span style=
"text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>“When I coached in Dumas, Texas…I took up a new pursuit, golf…I
was out there screwing around with golf every day and I was
starting to make progress. There was an ole boy who had a ranch and
was a wheat farmer. He had a lot of money and was a prominent
person around town…you don’t beat a big time guy in town for money.
So I kept saying no…I’ve got the job at Texas-Western and I am
going to be leaving town. Why not give the old rancher what he’s
been begging for? It’s the least I could have done, right?…I just
wiped him out. He was so rich he thought it was funny. He kept
saying, ‘Damn, coach, for months I couldn’t get you to play for
fifty cents and now you’ll play for twelve hundred dollars?’ Yeah,
well that how hustlers do it.” (Page 77)</p>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Nolan Richardson</h1>
<p><strong><span style=
"text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>“The first player I ever met at Texas Western was Nolan
Richardson. He was a sophomore…I pulled up in a U-Haul truck full
of family and furniture. He shook my hand and helped us move in…He
would go on to be a successful college coach himself, winning the
1994 NCAA title at Arkansas. He’s a legend in El Paso, the town
even named a middle school after him.” (Page 82)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Willie Brown</h1>
<p><strong><span style=
"text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>“Willie Brown from New York, who would become a great player, a
big success in business, and later instrumental in helping me to
recruit the core of my 1966 national team…When I got the job I
started receiving a letter from Willie every day asking me to give
him a scholarship. Every day here came a letter…I figured that if a
guy is writing me every day it must mean he couldn’t play dead…My
wife, Mary, however, liked him for his hunger. She was impressed
with him…she encouraged me to sign Willie.” (Page 86)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>The First Bobby Joe Hill</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I call him the first because he was not the Bobby Joe Hill who
would play on the 1966 championship team. Same name, different
player.” (Page 87)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The only reason I got him was no one else would take him…Bob
Rogers said, “There’s a black kid down her that I can’t take.”..He
spent time in a reformatory in Huntsville, Texas. A reformatory?
Why the hell would I want a guy out of a reformatory? (Page 88)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It turns out Bobby Joe and two of his friends broke into a
Laundromat and, this part I will never forget, they stole $3.75—you
can’t be a little bit pregnant when it comes to stealing—but I’m
not sure a buck and a quarter haul each merited arresting all three
of them…The sheriff to his credit, said that day, ‘I’m going to
tell you the truth, if them boys weren’t colored they wouldn’t have
been arrested.” (Page 88)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Coaching Black Players</h1>
<p><strong><span style=
"text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>“When I looked out on the floor I didn’t see white guys and
black guys, I saw players.” (Page 90)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>‘I treated my white guys and my black guys exactly the same. I
don’t think it was because I was some enlightened individual, it
wasn’t a conscious thing. I think it was that I was obsessed with
basketball and I didn’t want to go into that opener against Iowa
State and get my ass beat.” (Page 91)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>&nbsp;</h5>
<h5>&nbsp;</h5>
<h5><span style="color: #ff0000;">Chapter 7-Bad News</span></h5>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Haskins gives credit to Jim Barnes</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Jim “Bad News” Barnes. In the history of Texas Western/UTEP
basketball there may never have been a more important player that
Jim “Bad News” Barnes” (Page 101)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“he set the stage for our success in the years to come.” (Page
101)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Jim Barnes showed kids around the country that Texas Western
was a place where great players played. Nothing attracts great
recruits like great players.” (Page 107)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Barnes was so good that my sports information director, Eddie
Mullens, in a promotional effort, hung a nickname on him. He was
Bad News Barnes because he was bad news for the opposition.” (Page
107)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We finished 25-3 Barnes’ senior year (1963-64) and darn near
won the national championship. In fact, to this day I still we
should have won it. The three games we lost were the games that
Barnes fouled out.” (Page 109)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Free Throw Contest</h1>
<p>“I bet Barnes that I could beat him in a free-throw shooting
contest…We’d each shoot twenty-five free throws. If he hit more
than I did, I would go back to El Paso and never bother him again.
If I hit more, then he would sign with Texas Western right then and
there. I told him I wouldn’t even take my sports coat off. He
laughed and agreed to the terms of the bet…He went first and hit
seventeen of twenty-five. I got up there and hit the first eighteen
with no trouble at all, stopped and said, “Sign.” (Page 106)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Breaking NCAA Rules</h1>
<p><strong><span style=
"text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>“ I don’t know if the NCAA had a rule against betting a
commitment with a player on a shooting game, but I would have to
think it violated some rule or another. So, I guess, I cheated to
get Jim Barnes, but it was worth it.” (Page 106)</p>

Players</span></h5>
<p><strong><span style=
"text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Haskins insists playing 5 black players was no bid
deal</strong></li>
<li>He doesn’t remember when it happened</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“When was the first time you started five black players?’ I
asked Haskins.</p>
<p>“Don’t remember, “ he said. “Never thought about it.” (Page
113)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“There is no official record of what game (or even what season)
the historic event occurred.” (Page 114)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I can’t remember the exact moment I decided to start five black
players.” (Page 116)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Anyone who played for me can tell you I treated everyone the
same, that race was not a factor in how I coached the team.” (Page
117)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“All I had done is exactly what a coach is supposed to do; I
started my five best players in an effort to maximize the chances
of winning the game. To me they were just kids in white and orange
uniforms. Not white guys, not black guys, just Miners. In later
years I coached Hispanics, Native Americans, and foreign players.
To me, they were all the same. They were my players. I certainly
wasn’t trying to make a social statement. I just wanted to win. If
my five best players were from Mars, I would have started five
Martians.” (Page 120)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Girls’ basketball wasn’t much back then, but I didn’t see the
difference. A team was a team. Players were players, white, black,
male or female. I was in charge of the ream and our goal was to win
games. Why would I care about anything else?” (Page 120)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Years later people would refer to our national championship
game against the University of Kentucky as the Brown v. Board of
Education of college athletics, the linchpin that broke the color
barrier for good. I always laughed at that. It was only big because
we won. What if we had lost?” (Page 120)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“At the time, the last thing I expected was it would become a
big deal. At the time I just wanted to win that game. Although,
honestly, I don’t even remember which game it was.” (Page 121)</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Haskins gives credit Hilton White who helped recruit
the championship team</strong></li>
<li><strong>Introduces players on the championship
team</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Hilton White</h1>
<p>“One of the keys to recruiting our championship team was a man
named Hilton White. He coached in the playground leagues in New
York City. And was just a class guy…The kids all loved Hilton and
if he said, “This is where you are going to school.” Well, that was
where they were going to school…Hilton was always in my corner…He
would tell them they needed to stay put, listen, and work harder…He
wanted what was best for his players, and what was best was getting
that education.” (Page 131-132)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>The Second Bobby Joe Hill</h1>
<p>“The second Bobby Joe Hill was the quickest guard I’d ever
seen.” (Page 125)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Over Coaching</h1>
<p>“I made him dribble the ball in front of him…he tried…but he
kicked the ball away about half the time…He got frustrated, but he
accepted it. He never bitched, never complained…It was my fault he
was struggling because I was overcoaching him.” (Page 125)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>David Lattin</h1>
<p>“He was the next “Bad News Barnes” (Page 126)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“David went to Tennessee State, but after a semester he was
miserable…”Coach send me a ticket and I’ll come to Texas Western. I
want to come and play for you . Just send me the ticket.”…One plane
ticket and I get David Lattin? That didn’t seem like a big deal.
But it was illegal…I can’t do it David. You’ll have to find a way
here yourself.’…I am here. I came by bus. He had taken a bus
straight through, for twenty-four hours….It turns out (as I would
find out many years later) that just picking David up in downtown
El Paso and driving him a few miles to campus was violating one of
the NCAA’s more questionable rules.” (Page 128)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“he was a big, tough guy with a cool Fu Manchu. His nickname was
Big Daddy D…and had a teal popular radio show called “The Big D
Jazz Session…I once asked him if he had any bad habits at all and
he smiled and said. “Chasing babes.” (Page 129)</p>

<h1>Don’t Box yourself in</h1>
<p>“The next player who shows up late is kicked off the team. Gone.
Cut. No appeals. Well, the guy who shows up late is Jimmy Holmes,
who was from El Paso and had never been on my bad side….He even had
a good excuse for being late, he was in class. I had boxed myself
in and I kicked him off the team anyway…That was over forty years
ago and to this day I feel bad about that. It was bad judgment.”
(Page 131)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Willie Cager</h1>
<p>“First off, not only did Willie Cager not play high school
basketball, he hadn’t gone to high school. He had worked and gotten
his diploma by going to night school…He was helping his family.”
(Page 133)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I offered Cager a scholarship and never regretted it…Cager had
to take two college level English classes. He had no money, so he
came to El Paso and found a job working while going to class. He
didn’t have money for rent either…Willie got a cot set up in one of
the grease pits…when the shop was closed he slept in there.” (Page
134)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Nevil Shed’s Mother</h1>
<p>“She was a great woman—tough as nails. She wanted Nevil to get a
diploma and to call her if he gave me any problems and it would be
taken care of. Nevil was rightfully afraid of his mother…She saw
the incredible opportunities basketball could give her son—sadly,
it was rare that a black kid got to attend college.” (Page
134-135)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>TWC</h3>
<p>“Texas Westen College wasn’t exactly considered the coolest
thing in the neighborhood.” (Page 135)</p>
<p>“Texas Women’s College”</p>
<p>“Teeny Weenie College”</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h1>Value of a Basketball Scholarship</h1>
<p>“The players who go on to the NBA ate the ones who make millions
and get the media attention, but it’s the education so many of us
(myself included) get while playing college sports that’s
invaluable.” (Page 136)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Black Leaders</h1>
<p>“I get a lot attention for being the first to start five black
players in a game, but if it weren’t for all of the leaders in the
black community who helped send these kids to me it never would
have happened. There are countless heroes in this tale and I thank
all of them, even if they sent their players to someone else.”
(Page 136)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Helping communities</h1>
<p>“This wasn’t about just winning basket ball games. This was
about helping these young men, helping entire communities.” (Page
136)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Harry Flournoy</h1>
<p>Pie Incident</p>
<p>“ Harry Flournoy was walking home from school for lunch…I asked
if he wanted a ride. He said he didn’t….We drove to his house and
waited for him…I met his mother, Amy, a great woman…she offered me
the last piece of pie in the house…he sat down for lunch…asked his
mother for dessert. Amy said, “Harry, there is none left. I gave
the last piece to our guest, Coach Haskins…He was so made at me
that he wouldn’t let me drive him back to school…After the pie
incident I thought we would never sign him.” (Page 138)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mother comes to TWC</p>
<p>“Amy Flournoy trusted me and told her boy he was going to El
Paso…I loved that woman…Harry’s freshman year I caught him ditching
class and saw his grades were slipping, so I called her…He walked
in, saw his mother, and then we both read him the riot act. He was
scared straight. I don’t think Harry ever skipped class again.

<p><strong><span style=
"text-decoration: underline;">Businessman</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“West Texas has been good to Haskins except, it seems, when it
came to business…he drilled for oil and found nothing but dirt…His
friends all call him the smartest man they ever met, someone in
possession an uncommon amount of common sense…Haskins sunk $22, 500
into a lettuce field, a good chunk of savings… lost it all…As a
businessman, he made a hell of a basketball coach.” (Pages
141-142)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Fighting the Team</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I spent half the season worrying about Bobby Joe Hill, fighting
with David Lattin to practice hard, and trying to get everyone to
play together. This was easily the most talent4ed team I had ever
coached, but they were a pain in the ass when it came to practice.”
(Page 143)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I had to fight this team so hard every single day. WE had five
players…who were left-handed. So, maybe that explained it.”&nbsp;
(Page 151)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>David Lattin</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I was always trying to get Lattin jacked up…Lattin wouldn’t
play hard because the center was white. He didn’t think a white guy
could play.” (Page 143)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I gave the maintenance man a dollar and told him to tape it up
well above the square on the backboard…maybe fourteen feet up…in
walked David Lattin, he was always dressed teal nice, always well
groomed. He had on them Italian-looking shoes…Lattin just smiled,
walked over, and just hopped up there and picked it off the
backboard. No warmup, in dress clothes and Italian shoes…Moe starts
right in with me, “Lattin plays harder for money than he does for
you.” (Page 144)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Togo Railey</h1>
<p><strong><span style=
"text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>“Togo was the fan favorite, a local guy who played only when we
were up big. Late in the game the crowd would chant, “To-go,
To-go,” so I would put him in. He was my human victory cigar.”
(Page 145)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>No one wants to play TWC</h1>
<p><strong><span style=
"text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>“We were still Tiny Weenie College from El Paso. If your are a
major school…why would play us?…a no-win situation. If you win the
game, everyone says, ‘Well, you are supposed to beat them, that’s
TWC.’ But if you lose, and with the team I had the odds were pretty
good you weren’t going to just lose you were going to get your ass
kicked, the critics would be all over you…it was better just to
avoid us completely.” (Page 145)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>El Paso</h1>
<p><strong><span style=
"text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>“El Paso had no other sports teams then and really no national
identity al all…the people of El Paso embraced something of their
own and became Texas Western Miner fans. It was great…The fans were
unbelievable…their enthusiasm and support was out of control….when
we landed at the airport there would be two or three thousand
people waiting for us.” (Page 150)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Our city doesn’t get much national attention and back then it
was even smaller. Which is why the whole city was behind us, a
feeling I can’t describe, but am humbled about to this day.” (Page
169)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Breaking Curfew</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I was so angry with my team so I set a curfew that night…I
didn’t want any crap that night. Well, Bobby Joe apparently knew
some girls in Seattle and he and the rest of the team snuck out.
Probably the only funny thing about the whole incident was finding
Shed in his room…I went crashing into his room and he was under the
covers, looking at me with a smile, pretending like he was just
trying to get some sleep…He had the covers pulled up to his chin…I
yanked the blankets off of him and there he is, fully dressed,
shoes and all. I had caught him before he left….Angry doesn’t
describe me at that point…guys got back around 3:00 am…we woke them
up at 4:30 am claiming we had an early flight…on the plane if
anyone even looked like he was about to doze off to go back and
wake him up…I was too angry to sleep, then by God I wanted them too
angry to sleep.” (Pages 154-155)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“ I don’t think Haskins owns a real tie. He hates dressing up at
all, preferring an open collar with some room to breathe…Haskins
wore the tie for less than a minute each game, just long enout to
take the court with an air of business sensibility. ‘Mr. Iba told
me before my first game as a high school coach always to wear a
tie…I noted to him the entire building was named after him and, in
reality, the clip-on act wasn’t fooling anyone…’Mr. Iba said to
wear a tie,’ he said, ending the discussion and straightening the
tie.” (Page 159)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Bobby Joe Hill becomes a Leader</h3>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>“I was so mad at Bobby Joe Hill for the Seattle debacle, I
benched him..I noticed Bobby Joe wasn’t sitting back on the bench
pouting, like a lot of guys would. WE huddled up, and even though
he wasn’t playing, Hill was right in the middle, grabbing guys by
the shirt, getting in their faces, shouting encouragements, even
giving some advice on what he had seen. I loved it, He was, after
all, the leader of the team…seven minutes before halftime when I
put him in. The benching was over. He was such a smart player.
Instead of pouting he had studied the game. So once he got in the
game, problems solved, we won easily.” (Pages 163-164)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Team doctor-Technical Foul</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“my team doctor, Joe Galatzan, was sitting down at the end of
the bench hollering at an official something fierce for making a
bad call. All of the sudden the official gave my team doctor a
technical. I couldn’t believe it. My team doctor…I felt sorry for
him…Dr. Joe said, ‘Coach, I’m sorry.’ I said, ‘You didn’t do a damn
thing. I was fixin’ to get one myself.’” (Page 163)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Nevil Shed’s mother</h3>
<p>“a big old white boy, knocked the crap out of Jerry Armstrong
when Armstrong wasn’t looking, but Nevil Shed saw him. The next
time down the court Shed laid Rolfe out with a punch…Shed got
booted from the game…I wouldn’t let him sit on the bench. I sent
him to the dressing room and told him he was off the team,
sholarship revoked and everything. I was that angry…She came up to
me crying. He was apologizing and begging and carrying on. He had
called his mother…told her he was coming home and had been kicked
off the team…his mother wanted to speack to me…Most parents will
automatically defend their children…she says, ‘Coach, make that boy
walk home. Make him walk back to New York City. Don’t you even give
him a ride to the bus station.’…She was angrier at Shed than I was.
So I decided then and there to keep him on the team. I figured I
was saving him from the whipping of his life. I did bench him for
the start of the next game though.” (Pages 166-167)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Racism on the team</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>‘On our team, as far as I knew then or have ever heard, there
were no racial problems, no divisions. Jerry Armstrong was white
and when he got hit with a cheap shot, Nevil Shed, who was black,
didn’t hesitate to stick up for him. It wasn’t about race with us.”

<p><strong><span style=

<h3>Charitable and Humble</h3>
<p>“A young Mexican family were driving from Van Horn to Los
Angeles…their car broke down…out in the desert…Coach was out
hunting and he stopped to help. …this family had no money, so he
got a two truck to bring the station wagon to El Paso and loaded
the whole family into his truck. He then paid for the tow, paid to
get the car fixed, and since it took two days for the work to be
done, put the family up in a motel and gave them cash for food…he
didn’t tell a soul about it. Not one person. He didn’t want anyone
to know. He didn’t want any credit.” (Pages 171-172)</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h3>Jerry Armstrong stops Chambers/Utah</h3>
<p>“my black guys would never have gotten the chance to start in
that game if it wasn’t for one of their white teammates, Jerry
Armstrong…none of my big guys could stop Utah’s Jerry
Chambers…Lattin and Harry Flournoy were out. Chambers was just
unbelievable…Armstrong had a sprained ankle. Well, he did better
than anyone else had and slowed Chambers down at the end of the
game. We won 85-78, but only because of Armstrong. Maybe, Jerry
Armstrong is the white guy who should get the credit for
integrating college basketball. It sure as hell wasn’t me guarding
Jerry Chambers.” (Page 177)</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h3>The team</h3>
<p>“My guys were taking naps, daydreaming, looking for girls in the
stands. This was the loosest team I ever had.” (Page 181)</p>
<h3>Lattin dunks the ball to intimidate Kentucky</h3>
<p>“I told Lattin…I want yuou to take it to the rim and dunk it on
someone. Just knock them over. Just dunk it like they ain’t never
seen it dunked. Not in person, not on television. I don’t care if
you get called for a charge, for traveling, rip off the backboard,
anything. Just dunk the damn thing. Take it at their center and run
his ass over…To see the 240 pound David Lattin charging down the
land was one scary sight. Only one guy tried to defend the play,
Pat Riley. I respected him for that…David dunked it on his head,
just slammed it right down on his head. No foul. No travel. Just
two points for the Miners.” (Page 183-184)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Not a memorable game</h3>
<p>“Oddly enough the most memorable thing about the actual game was
the lack of memorable moments.” (Page 184)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“By the end they never really threatened u s. We led by 11 with
3:22 remaining. It didn’t end up a blowout, but we won fairly
easily, 72-65.” (Page 186)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Bobby Joe Hill steals the show</h3>
<p>“Bobby Joe stole it from him (Louis Dampier) and drove it for a
layup. Dampier regrouped and started bringing the ball up again,
this time more cautiously. But Bobby Joe was just so quick that
right at center court he did it again, picking Dampier;s pocket and
going in for another layup, 14 to 9 us with 9:56 to go…Everyone in
Cole Fieldhouse must have thought that anytime Bobby Joe wanted to
steal that ball from Louis Dampier he could. Bobby Joe certainly
thought that.” (Page 185)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The Media-Ed Sullivan Show</h3>
<p>“I know my three New York players (Shed, Worsley, and Cager)
were excited because back then the NCAA championship team usually
got invited to appear on <em>The Ed Sullivan Show,</em> which was
filmed in Manhattans. So they were more excited about a free trip
back home to New York than winning the championship. Of course, in
a sign of things to come, Ed Sullivan didn’t invite Texas Western
on his show.” (Pages 187-188)</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Haskins Loves El Paso</strong></p>
<p>“In six short seasons I had grown to love the city and the
school, so it meant a lot to me to give the people something to be
proud of. And it was one of the reasons why, when some bigger,
richer schools came a-calling after I had led little Texas Western
to the national title, I never left. El Paso was my home now.”

<h3>Giving the NCAA hell</h3>
<p>“Haskins arrived looking sharp by his standards—which meant his
plaid button down shirt had no barbeque stains…sitting in the front
row…this was the media and NCAA power base that had made life
miserable for him, his players and his program…the old cowboy had
neither forgotten nor forgiven…getting some shots in…noted his
decision was unpopular at the time. He named some names in the
media. He went on to criticize the NCAA…he got after them for the
confusing and corrupt way it enforces its myriad rules since, he
noted it is generally the big schools that are cheating their asses
off, but the small ones that get punished.” (Pages 191-192)</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h3>Positive Effects</h3>
<p>“Chuck Foreman, the great NFL running back, …stopped me and he
said, ‘I’ve always wanted to thank you for giving black guys like
myself a chance to go to school.’ He just said all the right
things, and it made me feel real good.” (Page 193)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Nolan Richardson would declare I was responsible for “thousands
of scholarships for blacks in the South.” (Page 193)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The positive impact of the fame through the increased
opportunity for black players. Before we beat Kentucky there was
not a single black basketball or football player in the
Southeastern, Southwest, or Atlantic Conference. Not one. A couple
months after we won, Vanderbilt of the SEC recruited the first
black basketball player and the floodgates opened.” (Page 194)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hate Mail</strong></p>
<p>“I thought winning the national championship was the worst thing
ever to happen to me. I wished for a long time that we had never
won that game with Kentucky because life would have been a heck of
a lot easier for me, my school and my players.” (Page 192)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Within a week of winning the national championship the hate
mail flowed in by the garbage bucket…There were bags and bags of
nasty, racist, ignorant letters. Most of them came for the South
and a lot of them form Kentucky.” (Page 193)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>New Version of Hate Mail</h3>
<p>“Black ministers calling me an exploiter. All of the sudden I
was the racist. Supposedly, I was just using black kids to win
games and I didn’t care at all about them…Nolan Richardson said,
“Coach, we’ve got them on both sides.” (Page 198)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Biased Media</h3>
<p>“Adolph Rupp (coach of Kentucky) said some thing to anger me…He
told the <em>Courier-Journal</em> of Louisville that I had
recruited David Lattin out of Tennessee State Prison, when in fact
David had been a student at Tennessee State University.” (Page
195)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“<em>Sports Illustrated</em> &nbsp;came to town…said I exploited
black players, that our kids weren’t real students and El Paso was
a community that was unfriendly to minorities…that El Paso was so
racist that none of my players’ wives could get jobs there. Wives?
None of my players were even married.” (Page 196)</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h3>Haskins Biggest Regret</h3>
<p><strong>“</strong>File a lawsuit again <em>Sports
Illustrated…</em>I deeply, deeply regret that I didn’t file one
myself…This was a mistake and perhaps the biggest regret of my
life. I have never forgiven the magazine. Not to this very day.
That magazine hurt my players and their parents. And it was wrong.”
(Page 196-197)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“1976 James Michener released a book called <em>Sports in
America</em>…Michener referred to our championship team as ‘one of
the most wretched episodes in the history of American sport.’ Can
you believe that? We were just college kids playing basketball. How
can that be wretched? He claimed my players were criminals and
nonstudents…suing Michener—not for the money though. I just wanted
to get him into an El Paso courtroom so I might get close enough to
get my hands around his neck, haul his ass outside, and drag him
through the weeds for a while. A good ass-kicking might have been
satisfaction enough for me…I deeply, deeply regret this to this day
I didn’t.” (Page 197)</p>
