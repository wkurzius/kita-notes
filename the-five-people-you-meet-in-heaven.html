        a falling carnival ride</span>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1><span style="font-size: medium;">Eddie was born in an apartment near
        Ruby Pier. He grew up there. His father was also a maintenance man
        at Ruby Pier. Except for the years he was away in the Philippines

        met his wife at Ruby Pier.</span></h1>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-size: medium;">This book
            is dedicated to Edward Beitchman, my beloved uncle, who gave me
            my first concept of heaven. Every year, around the Thanksgiving
            table, he spoke of a night in the hospital when he awoke to see
            the souls of his departed loved ones sitting on the edge of the
            bed, waiting for him. I never forgot that story. And I never
            forgot him.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Everyone
            has an idea of heaven, as do most religions, and they should all
            be respected. This version represented here is only a guess, a
            wish, in some ways, that my uncle, and others like
            him&mdash;people who felt unimportant here on the
            earth&mdash;realize, finally how much they mattered and how they
            were loved.</span></span></p>

<h1><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&ldquo;People often belitlle the
                place where they were born. But heaven can be found in the
                most unlikely corners. And heaven itself has many
                steps.&rdquo; (Page 34)</span></span></strong></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&ldquo;There are five people you meet
            in heaven&hellip; Each of us was in your life for a reason. You
            may not have known the reason at the time, and that is what
            heaven is for. For understanding your life on earth.&rdquo;
            (Page 35)</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&ldquo;This is the greatest gift God
            can give you: to understand what happened in your life. To have
            it explained. It is the peace you have been searching
            for.&rdquo; ( Page 35)</span></span></p>

        go to war. Sometimes because they have to, sometimes because they
        want to. Always they feel they are supposed to. This comes from the
        sad, layered stories of life, which over the centuries have seen
        courage confused with picking up arms, and cowardice confused with
        laying them down. (Page 57)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="color: #008000; font-size: medium;">&ldquo;Sacrifice
        is a part of life. It&rsquo;s supposed to be. It is not something to
        regret. It&rsquo;s something to aspire to. Little sacrifices. Big
        sacrifices. A mother who works so her son can go to school. A

<h2><span style="font-size: x-large; color: #000000;">Inspiration: The Real
        Eddie</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; color: #000000;"><em><strong>The lead
                character in "The Five People You Meet In Heaven" is a
                grizzled war veteran named Eddie, who dies on his 83rd
                birthday. The character was inspired by my real-life uncle,
                Edward Beitchman, who was also a World War II veteran, who
                also died at 83, and also lived a life like that of the
                fictional character, rarely leaving his home city, and often
                feeling that he didn't accomplish what he should have. The
                pictures here are of the "real" Eddie. The text is from an
                essay I wrote years ago about my uncle
                Eddie.</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; color: #000000;"><em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em><strong>
            I tell stories. For awhile I told stories through music and then
            I told stories in newspapers and later I told stories in books,
            the best known being <em>Tuesdays with Morrie</em>, a story
            about my old teacher who was living to the fullest even as he
            was dying. <br /> <br /> But before I started telling stories, I
            heard them. My family loved to rattle them off, especially the
            senior members, grandparents and uncles and aunts, usually
            around a Thanksgiving table, always with plates of food close at
            hand. These were stories about family, history, war, some might
            have even been closer to fairy tales. Someone would inevitably
            say, &ldquo;Oh, no, not THAT one again,&rdquo; but we would
            settle in and listen anyhow. I never minded. In fact, I loved
            it. Those stories made me feel part of something, gave me
            stories of my own, as if my elders&rsquo; tales, through their
            telling, could become my tales, too. <br /> <br /> One I always
            remembered was told each year by a favorite uncle of mine, a
            squat, ex cab driver who had served in World War II and was a
            pretty gritty guy. He talked of a night when he went to the
            hospital with a raging fever. In the middle of that night, he
            said, he woke up and saw his dead relatives, waiting for him at
            the end of his bed.<br /> <br /> Of course, we kids asked him
            breathlessly, &ldquo;What did you do? What did you do?&rdquo;
            And being the salty fellow he was, he shrugged and said,
            &ldquo;I told them to get lost. I wasn&rsquo;t ready for them
            yet.&rdquo;<br /> <br /> I filed that story away in my head, but
            I never forgot it. And I never forgot my uncle, even as he aged
            into his 70&rsquo;s and 80&rsquo;s. As I got older, I saw him as
            a tough, devoted but sad old man who never got to see his dreams
            fulfilled and never really knew how much we loved him.<br />
            <br /> When time came for me to write something after
            <em>Tuesdays with Morrie</em>, I moved slowly. I didn&rsquo;t
            want to do any sequels. No &ldquo;Wednesdays with Morrie.&rdquo;
            No self-help series. I wanted to return to the world of stories,
            to delve deeper into life and death and the connections between
            the two - which lead me, inevitably, to the idea of
            heaven.<br /> <br /> Somewhere, swimming in my head, was the
            image my uncle had given me around that table, a handful of
            people waiting for you when you die. And I began to explore this
            simple concept: what if heaven was not some lush Garden of Eden,
            but a place where you had your life explained to you by people
            who were in it &ndash; five people - maybe you knew them, maybe
            you didn&rsquo;t, but in some way you were touched by them and
            changed forever, just as you inevitably touched people while on
            earth and changed them, too.<br /> <br /> And so, one predawn
            morning, coffee in hand, I sat down to write my next story,
            which now, several years later, is presented to you here.
            It&rsquo;s a tale of a life on earth. It&rsquo;s a tale of life
            beyond it. It&rsquo;s a fable about love, a warning about war,
            and a nod of the cap to the real people of this world, the ones
            who never get their name in lights.<br /> <br /> This story is
            also a personal tribute to my uncle, whom I only wish could be
            here to read it.<br /> <br /> By the way, his name was Eddie.
