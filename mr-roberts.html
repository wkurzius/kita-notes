                <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Mister Roberts is
                            aboard a US cargo ship, the <em>USS Reluctant</em> working in the
                            Pacific during the Second World War. He'd do anything to leave the
                            quiet of the ship to join in the "action". Trouble is, the captain
                            of the ship, is a bit of a tyrant, and isn't willing to sign
                            Roberts' transfer requests. Also on board is Ensign Pulver, who
                            avoids work as best he can, whilst living off the riches of his
                            buying and selling. Roberts and the crew are in constant battle,
                            even over the smallest of disagreements.</strong></span></p>

                <h4><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Act 1, Scene
                            1</strong></span></h4>
                <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong><em>Mister</em>
                            <em>Roberts</em> takes place aboard the U.S. Navy cargo ship
                            AK-601, operating in the Pacific. It begins a few weeks before V-E
                            Day. Just after dawn, as the sleepy crew ignores the reveille call,
                            Roberts reports to Doc that the previous night he observed a Navy
                            task force stretching for miles on the horizon. He shows Doc a
                            letter he has written requesting a transfer to combat duty. He
                            writes these letters every week, but the captain never approves
                            them. Dowdy tells Roberts the men must be given a liberty (time
                            ashore), which they have not had for over a year, since the captain
                            always denies their requests.</strong></span></p>
                <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>The men straggle onto
                            the deck. Insigna discovers he can spy on the female nurses as they
                            shower in the hospital on the island. The men all rush to see,
                            using their binoculars. Mannion and Insigna get into a fight, and
                            Roberts realizes he must get some shore leave for the men, to ease
                            their frustration and boredom. The captain cancels the movie that
                            night because a man was on deck without a shirt, a violation of
                            orders.</strong></span></p>
                <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
                <h4><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Act 1, Scene
                            2</strong></span></h4>
                <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Roberts tells Pulver
                            his plan to get the men ashore. He has offered a quart of whiskey,
                            which Pulver had been hoarding in a shoebox, to the Port Director,
                            whose job it is to decide where the ship goes next. Pulver is
                            dismayed because he has invited one of the nurses onto the ship,
                            and now he has no alcohol for her. Doc solves the problem by making
                            fake Scotch out of Coca-Cola, iodine, and hair tonic. Roberts
                            teases Pulver that he is afraid of the captain and never carries
                            out any of the pranks he thinks up, such as putting marbles in the
                            captain's overhead so they will roll around and keep him awake at
                            night. In a conversation with Doc, Roberts repeats his desire to
                            see combat. He knows the war is nearing its
                            end.</strong></span></p>

                <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>As the men load up a
                            Navy ship with supplies, Roberts disobeys the captain's orders not
                            to give out any fresh fruit. He also allows the men to remove their
                            shirts. The captain summons Roberts, but Roberts sends word he is
                            busy. The outraged captain comes on deck and picks a quarrel. He
                            criticizes the wording in Roberts' transfer request and tells him
                            not to write any more. He orders the men to put on their shirts,
                            but they refuse, until Roberts tells them to do so. The captain
                            tries to punish Roberts, saying that he will be confined to his
                            room for ten days, but he backs down when he realizes that Roberts
                            is indispensable to the running of the ship. The men are delighted
                            to have observed Roberts getting the better of the hated
                            captain.</strong></span></p>

                <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Pulver brings the nurse
                            Miss Girard onto the ship. He pretends to have seen combat action
                            and to be the executive officer. He tries to take her to his cabin,
                            but on the way, they run into the men. Insigna makes a remark that
                            reveals the men have been spying on the girls. Miss Girard verifies
                            with a pair of binoculars what has been happening and promptly
                            leaves, saying she has promised to help the girls put up curtains.
                            The men are disappointed that their sport has ended, but Roberts
                            cheers them up by announcing that they are going to Elysium Island,
                            where they will have shore leave.</strong></span></p>

                            if Roberts stops writing letters requesting a transfer. The captain
                            hates Roberts but needs him. If Roberts leaves the ship, the

                            commander. Roberts at first refuses to go along with the captain's
                            plan, but eventually agrees to it. The captain also gets him to
                            promise not to talk back to him in front of the crew, or to tell

                            gate-crashed a dinner-dance for Army personnel. Roberts deals with

                            pleased with them because they have bonded as a crew. After more

                            he does a good job. He gives Roberts some orders, which Roberts
                            obeys, to the consternation of the men. Dolan produces a bulletin
                            that says there is an urgent need for experienced officers aboard
                            combat ships. But Roberts is reluctant to sign the letter Dolan has

                <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>The crew think that
                            Roberts has buckled under to the captain because he wants a
                            promotion. He has also put Dolan "on report," a disciplinary
                            measure, which has further upset the men. Roberts begs Doc to
                            transfer him to the hospital on the next island, but Doc refuses.
                            After they hear an announcement on the radio that the war in Europe
                            is over, they call for a celebration. Pulver tells of his latest
                            scheme, to throw a firecracker under the captain's bunk. He goes to
                            the laundry room to test it, and there is a tremendous explosion.
                            He returns, unhurt but covered in soapsuds. Roberts wants to make
                            another firecracker, but Pulver says he has no more materials. He
                            is disappointed that he has let Roberts down.</strong></span></p>

                            but the men remain unfriendly. After the men exit, Roberts takes
                            the palm tree from the container and throws it over the side. The
                            captain enters, notices the absent palm tree, and orders the crew
                            to battle stations. He demands to know who did the prank and
                            guesses it was Roberts. Roberts denies any knowledge of it, and the
                            captain gets so worked up he makes himself ill. After Roberts
                            leaves the captain/s cabin, the men once more treat him with

                            The men are reading their mail. Pulver reads a letter from Roberts,
                            dated three weeks earlier. He is aboard a destroyer that has been
                            subject to four air attacks at Okinawa. He is happy to be in the
                            war at last. He keeps the "medal" his men gave him on his desk,
                            saying he would rather have it than a Congressional Medal of Honor.
                            Pulver then reads another letter he has received from a friend who
                            serves on the same ship. The letter informs him that Roberts is
                            dead, following a Japanese suicide attack. Pulver throws the palm
                            trees over the side, goes to the captain's cabin, and announces
                            what he has done. Then he challenges the captain about why there is
