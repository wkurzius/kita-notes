<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000; font-size: medium;"><strong>Central Issues</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><br />On page 16, how does Ishmael describe the moon? How does he compare it to human behavior?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="color: #0000ff;">"We must strive to be like the moon...the adage served to remind people to always be on their best behavior and to be good to others...People complain when there is too much sun and it gets unbearbly hot, and also when it rains too much or when it is cold. But no one grumbles when the moon shines. Everyone becomes happy and appreciates the moon in their own special way. Children watch their shadows and play in its light, people gather at the square to tell stories and dance through the night. A lot of happy things happen when the moon shines. These are some of the reasons why we should want to be like the moon." (17)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ismael describes the moon as something people always like in their own way because the moon gives light to a dark night, children play in the moon's shadow and tell stories by the moon light. Ismael notices that people complain about the weather, the sun, the heat and the cold all the time. People do not complain about the moon. Ishmael thinks people should be more like the moon and be happier.</span><br /></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Why are child soldiers being recruited? What are the advantages?</strong><br /></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><br /></strong>Boy soldiers are being recruited for the Sierra Leone Army and the Rebel Army because there are so many young boys who are homeless and without a family. The boys are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">looking </span>for a "new family". These boys want to belong to someone or something. There are several advantages to having boy soldiers. They are young and do not questions authority and they follow directions without asking questions. They are homeless and have no family and are desperate to "belong" and have someone take care of them. Also, the boys are angry that they have lost their homes and family and are fierce fighters. Children want to please adults, they are people pleasers and this is a great advantage for the military leaders.<br /></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>How does the rehabilitation center help Ishmael? What steps are taken to get him back on track?</strong><br /></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><br /></strong>The rehab center's purpose is to assimilate (fit in)&nbsp; Ishmael back into society. The center gives Ishmael a roof over his head and 3 meals a day, so that his basic needs are met. He is given medical care, counseling and schooling. The center tries to reunite Ishmael with someone in his family (his uncle), as well.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">"They know now that it is possible for boys to be rehabilitated" (169).<br /></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #1c0ef0;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">"I would always tell people that I believe children have the resilience to outlive their suffering, if given the chance" (169).</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #1c0ef0;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>How does Ishmael view himself as a soldier? How did he earn the rank of "junior lieutenant"?<br /></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Ishmael feels he was a good soldier. He followed orders and was good at what he did. He made the Army is family and was very loyal and dedicated to the Lieutenant. Ishmael thought he was honoring his family, his real family and his adopted military family, by being a soldier. </span></span><span style="color: #1c0ef0;"><span style="color: #000000;">While in the hospital, Ishmael remembers his time in the army as a "Junior Lieutenant". He tells the reader about a raid on a village he was in charge of. They killed all of the villagers, but captured enough food, drugs and ammunition for several months. <br /></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #1c0ef0;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ishmael and Alhaji were very good soldiers and acquired nicknames they were very proud of.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br /></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #1c0ef0;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong>profusely-</strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">excessive and great amount-<span style="color: #ff0000;">It was so hot in the jungle that Ishmael was sweating profusely and blinded by the sweat pouring into his eyes.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
