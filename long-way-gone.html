    <h1>Long Way Gone</h1>
    <h2><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"I
            began</span>&nbsp;<span style="color: dodgerblue;">to worry,
            because last time I had found someone in the village who had gone
            to school with us and saved us. This time we were a long way from
            Mattru Jong. A long way gone" (Beah, 65).</span></h2>
    <p><em><strong><br></strong></em><strong>Essay quotes</strong></p>
    <p><strong>LOSS OF INNOCENCE FROM THE WAR-ISHAMEL</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"We had not only lost our
            childhood in the war but our lives had been tainted by the same
            experiences that still cause us great pain and sadness" (Beah,
            202).</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">The villages that we captured
            and turned into our bases as we went along and the forests that we
            slept in became my home. My squad was my family, my gun was my
            provider and protector, and my rule was to kill or be killed...My
            childhood had gone by without my knowing...my heart had frozen...In
            my head my life was normal" (Beah, 126).</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">Our innocence had been replaced
            by fear and we had become monsters" (Beah, 55).</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>HOPE-ISHAMEL</strong></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"When I was very little, my
            father used to say, 'If you are alive, there is hope for a better
            day and something good to happen. If there is nothing good left in
            the destiny of a person, he or she will die.' I thought about these
            words during my journey, and they kept me moving even when I didn't
            know where I was going. The words became the vehicle that drove my
            spirit forward and made it stay alive" (Beah, 54).</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"Every morning we would cast
            our suffering aside and intelligently discuss solutions to the
            problems facing children in our various countries...our faces and
            eyes glistened with hope and the promise of happiness" (Beah,
            198).</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>UNCLE TOMMY</strong></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"you can come and live with me.
            You are my son. I don't have much, but I will give you a place to
            sleep, food, and my love" (Beah, 172).</span></p>
    <p><strong>REPATRIATED/FOSTER HOME-ISHMAEL</strong></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"I&nbsp;suspected he had found
            me a foster home and that I was going to be 'repatriated'--the term
            used to describe the process of reuniting ex-child soldiers with
            their former communities" (Beah, 171).</span></p>
    <p><strong>REHABILITATED-ISHMAEL</strong></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"They know now that it is
            possible for boys to be rehabilitated" (Beah,
            169).&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><strong>RESILIENCE OF CHILDREN-ISHMAEL</strong>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"I would always tell people
            that I believe children have the resilience to outlive their
            suffering, if given the chance" (Beah,169).</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;<strong>GIVE THEM A CHANCE-ISHMAEL</strong></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"I would always tell people
            that I believe children have the resilience to outlive their
            suffering, if given the chance" (Beah, 169).</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;<strong>NOT YOUR FAULT- (ESTHER)</strong></p>
    <p>The lives I had lived before and during the war. <span style="color: dodgerblue;">'None of these things are your
            fault' she
            would always stay sternly at the end of every conversation. Even
            though I had heard that phrase from every staff member--and frankly
            I had alway hated it--I began that day to believe it. It was the
            genuine tone in Esther's voice...that didn't make me immune for the
            guilt that I felt for what I had done. Nonetheless, it lightened my
            burdensome memories (Beah, 165).</span></p>
    <p><strong>COWARDS</strong></p>
    <p>famous speech from <em>Julius Caesar</em> "<span style="color: dodgerblue;">Cowards die many times before their
            deaths"
            (Beah, 104).</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;<strong>THREE WORLDS-ISHMAEL</strong></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"These days I live in three
            worlds: my dreams, and the experiences of my new life, which
            trigger memories from the past" (Beah, 20).</span></p>

    <h2><strong>Chapter 1-Pages 5-17 "The First Time Ishmael is Touched
            by the War"<br></strong></h2>
    <p>January 1993</p>
    <p>Ishmael (author and narrator) leaves his hometown of Mogbwemo to
        go to a talent competition with his older brother Junior.</p>
    <p>They cannot go home because their hometown is destroyed by rebel
        fighters</p>
    <p>Ishmael and his brother Junior stay with his grandmother in
        Kabati</p>
    <p>Family Information</p>
    <p>Mogbwemo is a town in the mining district</p>
    <p>Father works in the mines</p>
    <p>Mother is single</p>
    <p>Brothers: Junior (older) and Ibrahim (younger)</p>
    <p>Do not attend school (money issue)</p>
    <p>Parents do not live together, Ishmael mentions a stepmother</p>
    <p>Loves rap music</p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"The first time that I was
            touched by war I was twelve. It was January of 1993." (Beah,
            6)</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"The day seemed oddly normal.
            The sun peacefully sailed through the white clouds, birds sang from
            treetops, the trees danced to the quiet wind. I still couldn't
            believe that the war had actually reached our home. It is
            impossible I thought. When we left home the day before, there had
            been no indication the rebels were anywhere near." (10)</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"When&nbsp; the woman who had
            embraced him, and now cried with him, told him that at least he
            would have the chance to bury them. He would always know where they
            were laid to rest. (13)</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"Mogbwemo was no longer a place
            to call home and our parents couldn't possibly be there anymore."
            (Beah, 14)</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"I became afraid, since I could
            no longer tell the difference between dream and reality." (Beah,
            15)</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"We must strive to be like the
            moon...the adage served to remind people to always be on their best
            behavior and to be good to others...People complain when there is
            too much sun and it gets unbearbly hot, and also when it rains too
            much or when it is cold. But no one grumbles when the moon shines.
            Everyone becomes happy and appreciates the moon in their own
            special way. Children watch thier shadows and play in its light,
            people gather at the square to tell stories and dance through the
            night. A lot of happy things happen when the moon shines. These are
            some of the reasons why we should want to be like the moon." (Beah,
            17)</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2><strong>Chapter 2-Pages 18-20- "Living in Three
            Worlds"</strong></h2>
    <p><strong><br></strong>Ishmael is living in NYC and has a
        nightmare, a flashback to the civil war in Sierra Leone.</p>
    <p>Ishmael feels caught up in 3 lives: his dreams, his new life and
        his memories of being a child soldier.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"These days I live in three
            worlds: my dreams, and the experiences of my new life, which
            trigger memories from the past." (20)</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;<br>
        <strong>Chapter 3-Pages 21-25-"The Attack on Mattru
            Jong"<br></strong>
    </p>
    <p><strong><br></strong>Ishmael's hometown of Mattru Jong is
        attacked by rebels RUF (Revolutionary United Front)</p>
    <p>The rebels violently kill many women and children.</p>
    <p>Ishmael and his brother, Junior must flee the rebels.</p>
    <p>They hide "in the bush".</p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"They carved their initials,
            RUF (Revolutionary United Front), on his body with a hot bayonet
            and chopped off all of his fingers with the exception of his
            thumbs". (Beah, 21)</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"That night for the first time
            in my life I realized that it is the physical presence of people
            and their spirits that gives a town life" (Beah, 22).</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"They (the rebels) didn't want
            people to abandon the town, because they needed to use civilians as
            a shield against the military" (Beah, 24).</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"for young boys, the risk of
            staying in town was greater for us than trying to escape. Young
            boys were immediately recruited, and the intitials RUF were carved
            wherever it pleased the rebels, with a hot bayonet" (Beah,
            24).</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2><strong>Chapter 4-Pages 26-29-"Hungry All the
            Time"</strong></h2>
    <p><strong><br></strong>Main idea of the chapter is the hunger
        Ishmael and his friends feel all the time.</p>
    <p>Ishmael and 5 of his friends sneak back to Mattru Jong to get
        money for food.</p>
    <p>There is no place to buy food, all of their efforts to get money
        was useless.</p>
    <p>Using logic is no longer sensible, the war has changed
        everything.</p>
    <p>Eat raw cassava (a root vegetable, used to make tapioca)</p>
    <p>Ishmael and his friends begin to steal food.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"Tears formed in my eyes, but I
            was too hungry to cry" (Beah, 26).</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"After all the trouble and risk
            we undertook to get the money, it became useless...We had made a
            logical decision and it had come to this. It was a typical aspect
            of being in war. things changed rapidly in a matter ofseconds and
            no one had any control over anything" (Beah, 29).</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"We had yet to lerarn these
            things and implement survival tactics, which as what it came down
            to" (Beah, 29).</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>&nbsp;<strong>Chapter 5--Pages 30-36-"A Close Call with the RUF
            Rebels"<br></strong></h2>
    <p><strong><br></strong>Hunger continues to be a major issue.</p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"We were so hungry that it hurt
            to drink water and we felt cramps in out guts" (Beah,
            30).</span></p>
    <p>Ishmael and his friends attack a 5 year old boy to steal the
        corn he is eating.</p>
    <p>Ishmael notices a change in the "gentle" nature of his
        culture.</p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"Before the war a young man
            wouldn't have dared to talk to anyone older in such a rude manner.
            We grew wup in a culture that demaned good behavior from everyone,
            and especially from the young. Young people were required to
            respect their elders and everyone in the community" (Beah,
            33).</span></p>
    <p>Ishmael and his friends are captured by the RUF rebels, but
        manage to escape.</p>
    <p>They decide to leave the village for somewhere safe, but don't
        know where that may be.</p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"The following morning, we
            started speaking to each other as if awakened from a nightmare or a
            dream that had given us a different take on life and the situation
            we were in. We decided to leave the village the next day and go
            somewhere safe, somewhere far away from where we were. We had no
            idea where we would go or even how to get to a safe place, but we
            were determined to find one" (Beah, 36).</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2><strong>Chapter 6--Pages Pages 37-43-"Every Sranger is an
            Enemy"<br></strong></h2>
    <p><strong><br></strong>The Civil War is causing people to be very
        mistrustful.</p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"People were terrified of boys
            our age. Some had heard rumors about young boys being forced by
            rebels to kill their families and burn their villages...we reminded
            them of the massacres...This was one of the consequences of civil
            war. People stopped trusting each other, and every stranger became
            an enemy" (Beah, 37).</span></p>
    <p>Enter a new village, Kamator,&nbsp; captured by the village
        gaurds (civilians, not rebels)</p>
    <p>A young boy in the village recognizes Ishmael and his friends
        from the talent show and their dance/rap group.</p>
    <p>They are saved by this young boy.</p>
    <p>Ishmael's brother is depressed, he is not talking to
        Ishmael.</p>
    <p>Ishmael and his friends stay in this village for almost 3 months
        and work as look-outs and farm hands.</p>
    <p>Farming is very hard, back breaking work. Ismael and his friends
        have never farmed before.</p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"I had always been a spectator
            of the art of famring and as a reult never realized how difficult
            it was until those few months of my life, in 1993, when I had to
            assist in farming in the village of Kamator" (Beah, 41).</span></p>
    <p>There is a rebel attack and they have to abandon the Kamator
        area. All the time and effort spent farming was just a big
        waste.</p>
    <p>Flashback</p>
    <p>While watching some young boys from Kamator playing, Ishmael has
        a flashback to when he was 7 years old.</p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"I was a troublewome boy as
            well and always got into fights in school and at the river.
            Sometimes I stoned kieds I couldn't beat up. since we didn't have a
            mother at home Junior and I were the misfits in our community. The
            separation of our parents left marks that were visible to the
            youngest child inour town. We became the evening gossip"

    <p>Ishmael heads towards the island of Bonthe, where it is supposed
        to be safe.</p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"Bonthe, an island in the south

    <p>&nbsp;As Ishmael walks to Bonthe he gets lost in the forest all
        alone for 1 month.</p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"I was lost and lonely, it was
            safe for the time being" (Beah,50).</span></p>
    <p>He is very scared.</p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"Sometimes I closed my eyes

    <p>Ishmael lives in the forest near a spring for many days and

    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"The nameless fruit beacame my

    <p>Ishmael is terribly lonely in the forest.</p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"The most difficult part of
            being in the forest was the loneliness. It became unbearable each
            day" (Beah, 52</span>).</p>
    <p>Wild pigs in the forest are a danger to Ishmael.</p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"the wild pigs have distrusted
            all humans, and whenever they see a person in the forest, they
            think he or she is there to avenge the hunter" (Beah,
            54).</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;Ishamel spends more than a month alone in the forest, but
        he never gives up.</p>
    <h2><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"When I was very little, my

            day and something good to happen. If there is nothing good left in
            the destiny of a person, he or she will die.' I thought about these
            words during my journey, and they kept me moving even when I didn't
            know where I was going. The words became the vehicle that drove my
            spirit forward and made it stay alive" (Beah, 54).</span></h2>
    <p>&nbsp;After 1 month alone, Ishmael meets 6 boys, 3 of them are
        from Mattru Jong and they recognize Ishmael.</p>
    <p>Now Ishmael is traveling together with these 6 boys, but this is
        a problem. Everyone is afraid of the gang of boys.</p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"Our innocence had been
            replaced by fear and we had become monsters" (Beah, 55).</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;Ishmael and the 6 boys are known as "the seven boys"
        everyone is afraid of them.</p>
    <p>The next village they reach is deserted, everyone has run away
        because they are afraid of "the seven boys".</p>
    <p>There is one old man who was left behind in the village.</p>
    <p>He feeds the boys and tells them the way to the next
        village.</p>
    <p>The old man is afraid to tell the boys his name, he knows he
        will die before the war ends.</p>
    <p>The old man is sad that his country has changed so much.</p>
    <p>Ishmael continues to travel with the 6 boys, they are in
        constant danger and mistrusted wherever they go.</p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"Many times during our journey
            we were surrounded by muscular men with machetes who almost killed
            us before they realized that we were just children running away
            from the war...When we went to the river to wash our faces, mothers
            would grab their children and run home" (Beah, 57).</span></p>

    <p><strong><br></strong>The 7 boys reach the Atlantic Ocean and are
        amazed by its size and sound.</p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"We started haring something
            like the roar of big engines, the rolling of metal drums on a tar
            road, a thunder exploding, roll after roll...It was the Atlantic
            Ocean. Even in the middle of the madness there remained that true
            and natural beauty, and it toook my mind away from my current
            situation as I marveled at this sight" (Beah, 58).</span></p>
    <p>The boys feel safe and spend the morning acting like children,
        playing and having fun.</p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"It was a calm walk along the
            sand, since we didn't expect trouble in this part of the country"
            (Beah, 59)</span></p>
    <p>The boys come upon a village, the men of the village do not
        trust the 7 Boys, they take the boys "crapes" ie sneakers and let
        them go.</p>
    <p>Walking on the hot sand The Boys feet are burnt and cut.</p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"The sun was in the middle of
            the sky, it was 120 degrees, and we were barefoot...Walking
            barefoot on the sand was like walking on a hot tar road...I
            continued walking but couldn't feel the soles of my feet. (Beah,
            60).</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">" I felt sand particles digging
            into my bleeding soles...Peeled flesh hung down and congelaed

            skin" (Beah, 61).</span></p>
    <p>The Boys find a shack on the beach. The man who lives in the hut
        is very kind and generous. He cuts grass and lets the boys soothe
        their feet over steam, he feeds the boys, gives them ointment for
        their feet and lets them sleep in the hut.</p>

    <p>Saidu states <span style="color: dodgerblue;">"Every time people
            come at us with the intention of killing us, I close my eyes and
            wait for death. Even though I am still alive, I feel like each time

    <p>The 7 boys spend some time at a village where the villagers are
        very welcoming, allow them to hunt with them and allow them to join
        in their feast.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Musa tells the story of Bra Spider. A greedy spider that planned
        to eat all the food during the feasts in different villages by
        using a rope. He ended up being stuck in his web/ropes and getting
        a thin waist and NO food.</p>

    <p>The boys leave and spend the next night in a "peculiar village,
        in the middle of nowhere" really just 1 house with moldy pots.</p>
    <p>Ishmael spends the night remembering stories his grandmother
        told about the feast that was&nbsp; held the day of his naming
        ceremony.</p>
    <p>When the boys awake they find that their food is gone, when they
        investigate they find that a dog has stolen theri food and eaten
        it. They are angry enough to consider "killing and eating the
        dog".</p>

    <p><em>Ishmael recounts how the other boys lost their

        MattruJong. His mother was lost as the fled the village, when his
        father goes to look for her, the village is attacked again and Musa
        had to run, <span style="color: dodgerblue;">"he has been running
            ever since" (Beah, 79).</span></p>

    <p>Alhaki was at the river when Mattru Jong was attacked, when he
        went home to find his family, they were gone.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Kanei had escaped the village with his parents, but lost his
        sisters and brothers in the chaos. Kanei and his parents took a
        boat across the Jong River, but it capsized. Kanei was separated
        from his parents when he swam ashore. <span style="color: dodgerblue;">"The hope of finding his family has kept
            Kanei
            moving over the months" (Beah, 79).</span></p>

    <p>Saidu's family was attacked in their home. While Saidu happened
        to be in the attic getting rice, the rebels attack his family,
        raped his sisters, stole the family's property and forced the
        family to leave with them.</p>

    <p>The boys decide to travel at night and look for food and sleep
        during the day.</p>
    <p>One day a crow falls from the sky, they are hugry so they eat
        it.</p>
    <p>The next night Saidu faints from fright but the boys think he
        might be dying from eating the crow (bad meat?) He wakes up in the
        morning and they continue walking.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The boys arrive in a crowded village and find out that many
        people from Mattru Jong are in the next village (a 2 days
        walk).</p>
    <p>Ishmael is told his mother, father and 2 brothers are together
        in the next village.</p>

    <p><strong><br></strong>In this chapter Ishmael explains to the
        reader that his life has been reduced to taking drugs, watching war
        movies and killing.</p>
    <p><strong>The boys are taking drugs marijuana, methamphetamines
            (white tablets), brown brown (cocaine mixed with
            gunpowder).&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"We were always either at the
            front lines, watching a war movie, or doing drugs. There was no
            time to be alone or to think" (Beah,&nbsp;124).</span></p>
    <p>He does not "play" anymore he is a full-time soldier.</p>
    <p>His migraine headaches have gone away.</p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"In the daytime, instead of
            playing soccer in the village square, I took turns at the guarding
            posts around the village, smoking marijuana and sniffing <em>brown
                brown,</em> cocaine mixed with gunpowder, which was always spread
            out on the table, and of course taking more of the white capsules,
            as I had become addicted to them" (Beah,&nbsp;121).</span></p>
    <p><em><strong><br></strong></em><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"The combination of these drugs gave us a lot
            of energy and made us fierce...killing had become as easy as
            drinking water" (Beah,&nbsp;122</span>).</p>
    <p>Ishmael wins a contest. Who can kill a rebel the fastest, by
        slitting his throat with a bayonnet.</p>
    <p>Ishmael feels good as a soldier.</p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"I was part of something that

    <h1><strong>Its&nbsp;full&nbsp;name was the United Nations
            International Children's Emergency Fund.</strong></h1>
    <p>Ishmael has been a soldier for 2 years, he has lost his
        childhood and become a cold-blooded killer.</p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"The villages that we captured
            and turned into our bases as we went along and the forests that we
            slept in became my home. My squad was my family, my gun was my
            provider and protector, and my rule was to kill or be killed...My
            childhood had gone by without my knowing...my heart had frozen...In
            my head my life was normal" (Beah,&nbsp;126).</span></p>

    <p>In Bauya, the lieutenant holds a meeting, the boys smoke, take
        cocaine and "brown-brown".&nbsp; The meeting is social occasion,
        fun.</p>
    <p>The next morning workers from UNICEF arrive in Bauya. Ishmael
        and 14 other boys are chosen to go with the UNICEF workers. Their
        lives a soldiers is over, they are going to go to a school and find
        another life.</p>
    <p>Ishmael is angry and anxious, he has never been without his guns
        in over 2 years, he feels like he is losing his family.</p>
    <p>Ishmael and boys are taken by truck for a very long ride to
        Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone. He is still confused and
        angry.</p>
    <p>The boys are brought to a fenced compound and given a bed with
        clean sheets a locker and food. They are promised new "crapes"
        (sneakers) the next day.</p>
    <p>The boys are still upset and "looking for some good drugs in
        this place" (addicted to drugs)</p>
    <p>Ishmael meets other boys in this compound. They are suspicious
        of each other and start to fight.</p>
    <p>The boys learn they were all soldiers in the army. The do not
        understand why the army has kicked them out, they were good
        soldiers.</p>
    <p>Ishmael wants answers. He wants to know why he was taken out of
        the army and is now with "sissy civilians".</p>
    <p>He meets other boys who were part of the rebels.</p>
    <p>Ishmael and the "army boys" fight with the "rebel boys". 6
        people were killed, including some MPs (military police) and relief
        workers.</p>
    <p>The fighting makes the boys happy.</p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"No one screamed or cried
            during the fight. After all, we had been doing such things for
            years and were all still on drugs" (Beah,&nbsp;135).</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"a change of enviroment
            wouldn't immediately make us normal boys: <strong>we were
                dangerous, and brainwashed to kill"</strong> (Beah,
            135).&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"We needed the violence to
            cheer us after a day of boring traveling and contemplation about

    <p>The boys are moved by the MPs to a new rehab home, The Benin
        Home, in Kissy Town.</p>
    <p>They are searched for weapons this time.</p>

            (Beah,&nbsp;137).</span></p>
    <p>The boys have not had any drugs for a few days and are starting
        to go through withdrawl.</p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"All I could think about was
            what was going to happen with my G3 weapon and what movie my squad
            was watching that night, what good marijuana and cocaine were at
            their disposal...The drugs had begun to subside in my system...My

        angry and confused and going through drug withdrawl.</p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"It was infuriating to be told
            what to do by civilians...We were unhappy because we needed our
            guns and drugs" (Beah,&nbsp;138).</span></p>
    <p>The boys refuse to cooperate with the workers at the Benin Home,
        they constantly fight, refuse medical care, refuse to sleep on
        their beds indoors.</p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"We would fight for hours in
            between meals, for no reason at all" (Beah,&nbsp;139).</span></p>
    <p>The boys drag their mattresses outside every night to sleep.</p>
    <p>One night it rains and the mattresses are soaked. When the boys
        do not get new, dry mattresses they attack, Poppay, the man in
        charge of storage.</p>
    <p>Ishmael is having terrible migraine headaches as part of his
        withdrawl.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>One day the boys decide to break all the windows because they
        are angry and Ishmael cuts his hand badly.</p>
    <p>He ends up in the hospital because he has lost a lot of blood
        and is going through drug withdrawl. Even in the hospital, he
        refuses to be cooperative.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>While in the hospital, Ishmael remembers his time in the army as
        a "Junior Lieutenant". He tells the reader about a raid on a
        village he was in charge of. They killed all of the villagers, but
        captured enough food, drugs and ammunition for several months.</p>
    <p>Ishmael and Alhaji were very good soldiers and acquired
        nicknames they were very proud of.<strong><br></strong></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"Alhaji acquired the name
            "Little Rambo" and he did all he could in other raids to live up to
            that name...My nickname was "Green Snake," because I would situate
            myself in the most advantageous and sneaky position and would take
            out a whole village from under the tiniest shrub without being
            noticied" (Beah,&nbsp;144).</span></p>

    <p><strong><br></strong>The nurse, Esther,&nbsp; from the hospital
        comes to the Benin HOme to visit Ishmael. She is trying to convince
        Ishmael to come back to the hospital for care.</p>
    <p>Ishmael goes to the hospital, but he does not trust anyone, he
        is suspicious. He feels people just exploit each other.</p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"I didn't trust anyone at this
            point in my life. I had learned to survive and take care of myself.
            I had done that for most of my short life, with no one to trust,
            and frankly, I like being alone, since it made surviving easier"
            (Beah,&nbsp;153).</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Esther gives Ishmael a present to try to gain his trust. A Sony
        Walkman and a cassette tape of rap music. While Ishmael listens to
        music, she is able to examine him. Esther is concerned about the
        bullet wounds on Ishmael's legs.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Ishamel tells the reader about an ambush that occured while he
        was in the Army. The Army was ready to capture a village, when they
        were ambushed by the Rebels who were hiding in the trees and
        forests waiting for the Army. They fought for over 24 hours.
        Ishamel received many bullet wounds to his legs and 1 bullet was
        lodged in his foot. The doctor had to remove the bullet. Ishmael
        captures some rebels and punishes them for being shot in his foot.
        As a soldier, Ishmael became immune to violence, pain, suffering
        and death.</p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"We always destroyed the bases
            we abandoned so that other squads wouldn't be able to use them"
            (Beah,&nbsp;159).</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"I didn't think I was lucky, I
            thought I was brave and knew how to fight. Little did I know that
            surviving the war that I was in, or any kind of war, was not a
            matter of feeling trained or brave. These were just things that
            made me feel I was immune to death" (Beah,&nbsp;159).</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">" I shot them on their feet and
            watched the suffer for an entire day before finally shooting them
            in the head so that they would stop crying...I found their somber
            eyes irritating" (Beah,&nbsp;159).</span></p>
    <p>Ishmael hates to hear that all of the things he did in the Army
        were not his fault.</p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"None of what happened was your
            fault...I hated the 'It is not your fault' line that all the staff
            members said every time anyone spoke about the war...I rthrew the
            Walkman at her and left, putting my fingers in my ears so I
            couldn't hear her say 'It is not your fault"
            (Beah,&nbsp;160).</span></p>
    <p>As Ishmael is going through rehab he starts to remember his
        childhood, but this is painful. He has nightmares, cannot sleep and
        gets migraines.</p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"I tried to think about my
            childhood days, but it was impossible, as I began fetting
            flashbacks of the first time I slit a man's throat...tried to stop
            thinking, but I had a severe migraine that night. I rolled my head
            on the cold cement floor, but it didn't stop...The headache became
            so severe I couldn't walk...I still couldn't fall asleep...I
            couldn't face the nightmares" (Beah,&nbsp;160).</span></p>
    <p>Ishmael visits a larger hospital in Freetown and is assigned a
        UNICEF field worker who will help him find a place to live after
        the war.</p>
    <p>Ishmael spends large amounts of time listening to the Walkman
        and memorizing song lyrics, this helps him to stop thinking about
        the war.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Ismael has a break through. He has a dream about his family.
        <span style="color: dodgerblue;">"It was the first time I had
            dreamt of my family since I started running from the war"
            (Beah,&nbsp;165).</span>
    </p>
    <p>Ishmael talks to Esther a great deal and Ishmael starts to
        belive that being a child soldier and killer really was not his
        fault.</p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"The lives I had lived before
            and during the war. 'None of these things are your fault' she would
            alwats stay sternly at the end of every conversation. Even though I
            had heard that phrase from every staff member--and frankly I had
            alway hated it--I began that day to believe it. It was the genuine
            tone in Esther's voice...that didn't make me immune for the guilt
            that I felt for what I had done. Nonetheless, it lightened my
            burdensome memories (Beah,&nbsp;165).</span></p>

    <p>Ishmael is worried about living with a family after living on
        his own for so long.</p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"I was worried about living
            with a family. I had been on my own for years and had taken care of
            myself without any guidance from anyone. I was afraid that I might
            look ungrateful to my uncle...I was worried about what to do when
            my nightmares and migraines took hold of me. How was I going to
            explain my sadness..Why have I survived the war? Why was I the last
            person in my immediate family to live? I didn't know" (Beah,
            179).</span></p>
    <p>Ishmael says good-bye to his friends and Esther at the Benin
        Home, he nevers sees them again.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Ishmael goes to live with his Uncle Tommy and his family. They
        have a feast with chicken for Ishmael, this is a very special
        honor.</p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">&nbsp;"She made cassava leaves
            with chicken just to welcome me. To have chicken prepared for
            anyone was a rarity, and it was considered an honor" (Beah,
            181).</span></p>
    <p>Ishmael's cousin Allie takes him to a dance. He has a hard time
        enjoying himself because Ishmael remembers an attack of a school
        dance when he was a soldier.</p>
    <p>Ishmael tries dating girls but it is difficult because they ask
        questions about his past and he does not want to talk about his
        life.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Ishmael's caseworker, Leslie, visits and tells him about an
        opportunity to go to the UN (United Nations) in New York to speak
        about child soldiers and the war in Sierra Leone for CAW (Children
        Associated with War)</p>
    <p>Ishmael is selected.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Ishmael goes to the interview in the city, but keeps it a secret
        from his uncle.</p>
    <p>He is amazed by the city, especially his first ride in an
        elevator.</p>
    <p>Ishmael is chosen to go to the UN.</p>
    <p>Mr. Kamara form CAW and Ishmael begin the process of getting
        ready for the trip. Passport, visas, clothing, etc.</p>
    <p>The process is not easy. Ishmael is asked stupid questions "Do
        you have any money?" "Where is your passport?" "Do you know anyone
        in NYC?"</p>
    <p>Ishmael gets angry about the questions and process.</p>
    <p>Ishmael meets Bah, another boy from Sierra Leone who will go to
        the UN with him.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Ishmael says good-bye to his uncle and his family. His Uncle
        Tommy&nbsp; does not believe that Ishmael is really going to New
        York.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>&nbsp;<strong>Chapter 20--Pages 193-200 "New York City-A
            Strange New World"</strong></h2>
    <p><strong><br></strong>Ishmael travels to New York with Bah and
        Dr. Tamba. It is November on 1996, he will be 16 years old in just
        8 days.</p>
    <p>He is shocked by New York and America. Ishmael's only picture of
        NY comes from rap music.</p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"My conception of New York City
            came form rap music. I envisioned it as a place where people shot
            each other on the street and got away with it; no one walked on the
            streets, rather people drove their sports cars looking for
            nightclubs and for violence" (Beah, 193).</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>When Ishmael arrives in NY it is winter. He is shocked by the
        cold, the snow, the skyscrapers, lights, people on the street and
        the food.</p>
    <p>Ishmael and Bah stay at a YMCA, it is the first time he has ever
        had a room to himself and there is a TV.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Ishmael attends workshops and conferences, all part of The
        United Nations First International Children's Parliament. There are
        57 children from 23 countries.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"Every morning we would cast
            our suffering aside and intelligently discuss solutions to the
            problems facing children in our various countries...our faces and
            eyes glisttered with hope and the promise of happiness"
            (Beah,&nbsp;198).</span></p>
    <p>Ishmael does not have a winter coat. Laura Simms, one of
        instructors, gives him a woman's winter coat, but he is happy to
        have it.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Ishmael and the other children go sight-seeing to Times Square,
        Broadway, Rockfeller Center, The World Trade Center and use the
        subway.</p>
    <p>Ishmael gives a speech at the UN. Ishmael meets Laura Simms, a
        "story-teller".</p>
    <p>She will become his foster mother when he returns to NY.</p>
    <p>He is sad to leave NY but pleased to have gone to NYC.</p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"I was sad to leave, but
            I&nbsp; was also plesed to have met people outside of Sierra Leone.
            Because if I was to get killed upon my return, I know that a memory
            of my existence was alove somewhere in the world"
            (Beah,&nbsp;200).</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>&nbsp;<strong>Chapter 21--Pages 201-218 "Leaving Sierra
            Leone"<br></strong></h2>
    <p><strong><br></strong>Ishmael returns to Sierra Leone. His trip
        to NY feels like a dream.</p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"it felt like something that
            had all happened in my mind" (Beah,&nbsp;201).</span></p>
    <p>Ishmael starts school, but it is very difficult. The school has
        no supplies, it is very crowded and the teachers are not being
        paid.</p>
    <p>The other students at school treat Ishmael differently because
        he has been a child soldier.</p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"We had not only lost our
            childhood in the war but our lives had been tainted by the same
            experiences that still cause us great pain and sadness" (Beah,
            202).</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"I also began telling people
            that Mohamed was my brother, so that I wouldn't have to explain
            anything. I knew I could never forget my past, but I wanted to stop
            talking about it so that I would be fully present in my new life"
            (Beah,&nbsp;202).</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p>On May 25, 1997 war breaks again in Freetown. The government is
        overthrown by the military and the rebels.</p>
    <p>Ishmael has gone to buy food and gets caught in a riot.</p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"The entire nation crumbled
            into a state of lawlessness, I hated what was happening. I couldn't
            return to my previous life. I didn't think I could make it out
            alive this time...it got too dangerous to be in the open, as stray
            bullets had killed many people" (Beah,&nbsp;203).</span></p>
    <p><br>
        Ishmael is afraid to get involved in this new conflict.</p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"I knew I couldn't afford to
            lose my temper. The result would be death, since I was now a
            civilian; I knew that" (Beah,&nbsp;205).&nbsp; &nbsp;</span> &nbsp;
        &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Ishmael and his friend get stuck in town with the fighting. They
        are unable to get out of town, they hide and wait until night to
        sneak back home.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The gunshots in town did not stop for 5 months. People are stuck
        in their homes with the fighting.</p>
    <p>Ishamel's uncle gets sick. They cannot take him to the hospital
        and all the pharmacies are closed.</p>
    <p>His uncle dies.</p>
    <p>Ishmael is very depressed.</p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"I was always losing everything
            that meant something to me" (Beah,&nbsp;208).</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Ishmael calls Laura in New York, he asks her if he can come to
        live with her if he escapes Sierra Leone. She agrees.</p>
    <p>He must travel to the neighboring country of Guinea to get to
        New York.</p>
    <p>Many of the child soldiers who had gone through rehabilitation
        have rejoined the Army.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Ishmael leaves his uncle's house 7 days after his funeral.</p>
    <p>He sneaks out at night and goes to an old bus station to get out
        of Freetown.</p>
    <p>Ishmael takes a bus to Guinea, The bus passes through many
        checkpoints. At every checkpoint their papers are checked and the
        passengers have to pay soldiers and officials money to get out of
        Sierra Leone.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In Guinea Ishmael takes a bus to the Capital Conakry, it is 50
        miles and there are 15 checkpoints and all of the soldiers want
        money.</p>
    <p>At the last checkpoint a soldier takes Ishmael's favorite belt
        and he realizes he does not have enough money to get through the
        final checkpoint.</p>
    <p>He sneaks onto another bus and gets to Conakry.</p>
    <p>Ishmael finally gets to the Sierra Leone Embassy in Guinea.
        There are over 50 refugees in the embassy.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Ishamel ends the book with a fable told to children in Sierra
        Leone about a hunter who goes to the forest to hunt for
        monkeys.</p>
    <p>Right before the hunter is going to shoot the monkey, the monkey
        speaks and tells the hunter 'If you shoot me, your mother will die,
        and if you don't, your father will die' (217).</p>
    <p>Of course, there is no right answer to what the monkey has told
        the hunter. What do you do? Kill the monkey and your mother dies?
        Let the monkey live and let your father dies?</p>
    <p>Ishmael says</p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">"When I was seven I had an
            answer to this question that made sense to me. I never discussed it
            with anyone, though, for fear of how my mother would feel. I
            concluded to myself that if I were the hunter, I would shoot the
            monkey so that it would no longer have the chance to put other
            hunters in the same predicament" (Beah,&nbsp;218).</span></p>
